Neural networks have had a successful revival under the label \"deep learning\" in recent years. We'll try to get an overview on recent developments in this meetup. As for now, we have a presentation of a classical paper which highlights how the analysis of the visual cortex leads to new learning algorithms (\"sparse coding\" [1]). It would be great if we could find other presentations on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Recurrent Neural Networks and Large Scale Machine Learning.

The current trend is to use<b> Deep Learning</b> tools across a multitude of domains. However, there are alternate Machine Learning approaches which can perform robust and accurate reasoning and learning on complex relational data. Today in this talk, I will speak about one such approach of Markov Logic Networks (MLN) in <b>Statistical Relational Learning (SRL)</b>. MLN is a powerful framework combining combining statistical (i.e. Markov Random Fields) and logical reasoning (First Order Logic). I will highlight an example of how it can be used on text to do Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and extract affordances in the Robotics domain. This use case scenario shows how large scale inference on text can be leveraged to give knowledge to artificial assistants. This introductory talk would touch base on the basics and acquaint you with all the state of the art tools.
