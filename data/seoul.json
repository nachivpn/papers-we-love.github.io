(우리는 왜 이것을 하고 있냐구요?)</b></p> <p>Last workshop, we found that most of our participants were quite new to the 3D printing process. For this next workshop, we wanted to introduce the 3D printing process with a simple, practical, and festive activity. By attending, you will be walked through the entire 3D printing process, from design and 3D model slicing, all the way to printing and utilisation. Let me emphasise that this workshop is on the general process of 3D printing and not on any particular specifics.</p> <p><b>What do we hope to accomplish? (우리는 무엇을 달성 희망 합니까?)</b></p> <p>By the end of this workshop, you will feel comfortable enough with the 3D printing process to start exploring on your own, and to see the practical value of 3D printing.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/d/d/600_444119357.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>What exactly will we be doing this coming meetup (November 21st)? (이번 모임에서 정확히 무엇을 하는건가요?(11/21))</b></p> <p>We will guide you through the process of 3D printing your own (small) cookie cutter which you can use at home this holiday season to make fun cookie shapes! You will leave the workshop with a small 3D printed cookie cutter, the knowledge of how to process a 3D file for 3D printing, and some cookies as well (mmmmmm cookies)!

Build software, hardware, UI or even physical elements*</p> <p>Open-source devices provide you high-degree of flexibility to automate environment around you. Beacons-based services is another hot topic nowadays. Beacons enable location-based services for commercial venues, industrial spaces, offices, streets and even houses. Design and build your own beacon with Arduino or start working directly with services utilizing Reco beacons with easy to use SDK.</p> <p>Korea is famous with its fastest and ubiquitous broadband which waits for integration of your services. CISCO provides us elements of its infrastructure which you can utilize to integrate your solutions.</p> <p>All collected data and infrastructure are not useful if users don't have access to it. Another option for your project is to focus on elegant and usable applications.</p> <p>We've elaborated on several areas where you can focus during the hackathon. They are stimulus for your imagination - Go beyond. Now is your time to choose what you want to build.  </p> <p>*<i> in order to use 3D printers, contact hosts prior to the event (at least one week) </i></p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/0/1/600_441438433.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/0/4/600_441438436.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/0/7/600_441438439.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":0.0,"address1":"성동구 성수이로22길 37","address2":null,"name":"Maker Space, Seongsu IT Center","postalCode":null,"lon":0.0,"country":"kr","city":"Seoul"},"utcOffset":32400000,"time":1440806400000,"title":"Hackathon - Hack@Seoul: Seoul Build Days"},"238050818":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/seoul-tech-society/events/238050818/","description":"<p>More and more daily life activities and businesses are coming online, as well as arising danger of web security threats.

What made this usable was a \"Window Manager\". It gave you titlebars, the ability to move windows, resize them, virtual desktops, focus management etc. etc. ... At the time I had tried various Window Managers, and not being happy with Any of them I decided to teach myself C as a language, learn X11 and the raw libraries it was based on, and build myself a Window Manager. Now about 19 years later and over 1 million lines of C code still standing (not to mention all the code written, thrown away and replaced), a career now centered around it, It wasn't so hard, but I had no idea what I was getting into.

We at Ateam Ventures and Fab Lab Seoul are excited to be hosting this event series with Seoul Tech Society.</p> <p>안녕하세요 메이커, 디자이너 여러분. 저희 에이팀 벤처스, 팹랩 서울 팀원들은 Seoul Tech Society와  같이 이번 이벤트를 개최하게 되어 매우 흥분됩니다! :)</p> <p><b>Why are we doing this? (우리는 왜 이것을 하고 있냐구요?)</b></p> <p>This coming weekend, we want to provide you with a two-part community workshop.</p> <p>The first part of the workshop (10:30 AM - 12:00 Noon) will be for beginners to 3D printing in which we will teach you how to model your own keychain. You will need to bring your own (1) laptop/computer, (2) mouse with left/right click and scroll wheel and (3) download Autodesk 123D Design before we begin (<a href=\"http://www.123dapp.com/design\"><a href=\"http://www.123dapp.com/design\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.123dapp.com/design</a></a>). You will also need to bring 5,000 KRW for material costs (to be collected at the beginning of the workshop). As a special discount, if you post a picture on facebook of your 3D print or our 3D printer and tag us in the picture (@ATEAM Ventures), you will get 4,000 KRW back! Please make sure you complete steps (1), (2), and (3) all before you come to Fab Lab on Saturday!</p> <p>The second part of the workshop (1:00 PM to 2:30 PM) will be for people who already have a little bit of 3D printing experience already, or have completed the first part of the workshop. We will have materials for polishing both PLA and ABS printed objects, and a rotary tool and spare filament for friction welding. This second part of the workshop is totally free. We only ask that you bring your printed ABS and PLA objects, your friends, and of course yourself!</p> <p><b>What do we hope to accomplish? (우리는 무엇을 달성 희망 합니까?)</b></p> <p>By the end of the first part of the workshop, you will feel comfortable enough with the 3D modeling process to make your own keychains, and the 3D printing process to start exploring on your own.</p> <p>What exactly will we be doing this coming meetup (November 21st)? (이번 모임에서 정확히 무엇을 하는건가요?(11/21))</p> <p>In the first part of the workshop (10:30 AM - 12:00 Noon), we will guide you through the process of 3D modeling and printing your own keychain. We will show you how to sketch out a design in 2D, extrude that 2D sketch to make it 3D, convert your model into g-code using Cura, and then how to start a print on a 3D printer.</p> <p>For the 3D printing veterans, during the second part of the workshop (1:00 - 2:30 PM) our acetone vapour chamber and tetrahydrofuran, and Dremel for friction welding will be available for you to use. We will answer your questions or help you set something up however we can.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/4/7/600_444639751.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>What you need to bring if you are coming to the first part of the workshop (10:30 AM - 12:00 Noon)</b></p> <p>1) Yourself and any and all interested friends</p> <p>2) Your laptop/computer with Autodesk 123D Design downloaded (<a href=\"http://www.123dapp.com/design\"><a href=\"http://www.123dapp.com/design\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.123dapp.com/design</a></a>)</p> <p>3) A mouse with left/right click and scroll wheel</p> <p>4) 5,000 KRW cash to cover material costs (plastic for the 3D printers) [All \"profits\" are donated to Fab Lab Seoul!]</p> <p><b>What you need to bring if you are coming to the second part of the workshop (1:00 PM - 2:30 PM)</b></p> <p>1) Yourself and any and all interested friends</p> <p>2) Your plastic models (PLA and ABS) if you would like to do some polishing or friction welding outside of the organised workshop (totally free free free!)</p> <p><b>How, where, and when are these events happening? (언제, 어디서, 어떻게 이벤트가 진행되는건가요?)</b></p> <p>We plan on holding these \"workshops\" every other Saturday from 10:30 AM to 12:00 AM (Part 1) and 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, the closest workshop being this December 5th [masked]) at Fab Lab Seoul. Eduardo Charmorro (Fab Lab Seoul) and Joseph Choi (Ateam Ventures) will be there at the very least to provide guidance as needed.

The projects do not necessarily have to take the form of venture-funded startups. Launch lab is not limited only to entrepreneurs, but also open-source projects, non-profit organizations, and all other forms of group, club or organization with an idea for development. Of course, we will also help teams develop relationships with investors if a project has potential as a high-growth startup.</p> <p><br/><b>How? </b></p> <p>Apply via the Meetup RSVP. We will pre-select 6 ideas for presentations (10 to 15 minutes), and if anyone gets inspired during the event, we will also have an 'open mic' session for more ideas from any attendee. If you don’t get selected, don’t worry. There will be plenty of time for you to network with others and get feedback during the session. Remember, this is about creating a community, not about competition.</p> <p>If you have an idea but don’t want to present, bring it with you anyway.

How much and how easy…”</p> <p>Online fraud has long since moved from being a mere hobby to a means for cybercriminals to earn a living. Almost every day we can see reports of new cybercrime activity in social networks, blogs and forums, or the part of the easily 'visible' Internet.<br/>There is another side to the Internet however - its criminal underbelly - and here just like on the blogs and forums, communication is key. In this talk we will cover the principles of underground information exchange, ways to secure money/goods in underground transactions and basic cyber hierarchy.<br/>We will also talk about underground products and services. Crypt services, DDoS attacks, Traffic resale, Bulletproof servers, SMS Fraud, Spam services and Credit card Hijacking - these will be covered with pricing comparisons shown over the last 2-3 years. We will go through the typical pricing steps of a criminals attack - from buying software, all the way to monetize the volumes of infected victims.<br/>This presentation will be based on the Max's research paper: <a href=\"http://gmax.at/101\"><a href=\"http://gmax.at/101\" class=\"linkified\">http://gmax.at/101</a></a></p> <p>Topic 2:<br/>40 Min.</p> <p>“APT Targeted attacks use case and cyber underground”</p> <p><br/>We will analyse some of the most popular Russian underground forums where we can see footprints of possible APT announcement.
