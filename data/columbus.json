Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible.

Consumers are rightly wary of disclosing their personal information to cloud-based service providers. How can you build a service which delivers real value and is backed by a hard, cryptographic guarantee of security?</p> <p>\n\nWhat if it were possible for a customer to give their data to a cloud provider in encrypted form, and for that provider to perform useful computations on that data without ever decrypting it? The results would be delivered to the customer, encrypted with a key that only they knew. It sounds like an ideal solution, but maybe impossible?</p> <p>\n\nThis is the promise of homomorphic encryption. The idea has been around for some time, but it was considered intriguing but maybe not possible until Craig Gentry's groundbreaking thesis.

Backus presents a notion of \"functional programming\" which is decidedly different than how many people use that phrase.</p> <p><br/>At 30 or so pages, this paper is a bit longer than the others we've read, but it's also considerably more technical. If you find the algebra in the middle a bit much, you can get the general sense of the paper by reading sections 1-10 and 15-16 and skipping the rest.
