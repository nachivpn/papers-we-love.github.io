Is there some assignment to a and b that makes the expression true? This is the well known problem of Boolean satisfiability (SAT). This problem can be extended to predicates over non-Boolean values. For example, is the following satisfiable? (c &lt; d) ∧ (d ≤ c + 1). This extended problem is known as Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). In this talk, I will present an <a href=\"http://cis.upenn.edu/~alur/CIS673/smt11.pdf\">introduction to SMT</a> and its many applications, from scheduling to static program analysis to dependency resolution. I will end with concrete examples, demonstrating how to use an SMT solver from Haskell to prove assertions about a program.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/beala\">Alex</a> is software developer interested in using modern techniques to write more reliable programs, and is particularly optimistic about the intersection of industry and academia.
