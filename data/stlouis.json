In this paper, the colour of fresh apple juice was evaluated in the presence of different types of cyclodextrins (CDs) (α-CD, β-CD, γ-CD and maltosyl-β-CD), compounds that bind or complex polyphenol oxidase substrates. The effectiveness of CDs as browning inhibitors was determined as the difference between the colours observed in the CD-treated sample and the controls, using the colour space CIE-L∗, a∗, b∗ system. Although the effect of CDs on apple juice enzymatic browning has been studied, the action mechanism involved remains a subject of controversy. In this work, we have kinetically modelled apple juice enzymatic browning in the absence and presence of maltosyl-β-CD. The complexation constant between the mixtures of diphenols present in apple juice and maltosyl-β-CD was calculated (Kc = 4.09 mM−1). Different concentrations of maltosyl-β-CD modified the evolution of lightness (L∗), total colour (ΔE∗) and hue angle (H∗) because of the higher affinity constant it shows for the compounds responsible for apple juice browning than do α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD. Moreover, in this paper we show that maltosyl-β-CD can enhance the ability of ascorbic acid to prevent the enzymatic browning due to the protective effect of maltosyl-β-CD against ascorbic acid oxidation. Hence, maltosyl-β-CD seems to act as a “secondary antioxidant”, reducing apple juice browning and enhancing the naturally occurring antioxidant capacity of a food.\"</p> <p>Remember that we recently changed our meetup location: Ultralinq will be hosting us at 9666 Olive Blvd. in Olivette.
