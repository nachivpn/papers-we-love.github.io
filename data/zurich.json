Murray, Frank McSherry, Rebecca Isaacs, Michael Isard, Paul Barham, and Martín Abadi.</p> <p><br/>This <a href=\"http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp13/papers/p439-murray.pdf\">paper</a> proposes a very powerful computational model for dataflow programming designed to minimise unnecessary synchronisation. The idea is to have a system that can be the foundation for various data-processing frameworks that can interoperate. There is an open-source implementation in rust (<a href=\"https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow\"><a href=\"https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow</a></a>) by one of the authors.

Since then, the algorithm has been a part of teaching at many universities, has had many open-sourced implementations in multiple languages, and has found its way into production-level codes. This instantaneous acceptance into the systems building community raises an interesting question about what makes Raft so approachable than in comparison to others options, most notably Paxos?
