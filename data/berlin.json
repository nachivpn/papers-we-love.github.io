John McCarthy's original paper on Lisp is definitely one such work. It obviously set the stage for the various Lisps and Lisp-inspired languages, but it also pioneered a number of concepts, ranging from garbage collection to the call stack, that are deeply ingrained in today's programming reality. This talk will be mostly about historical perspective (and will not involve Lisp smugness or propaganda).</p> <p><br/>Bio:</p> <p>Marijn Haverbeke spent his early career living in the past and programming Common Lisp. When reality finally caught up with him he gave that up and became a JavaScript programmer instead. Author of CodeMirror and Eloquent JavaScript.

The key idea underlying soft typing is that a type checker need not reject programs containing \"ill-typed\" phrases. Instead, the type checker can insert explicit run-time checks, transforming \"ill-typed\" programs into type-correct ones.</p> <p>PDF: <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\"><a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></a></p> <p>Thanks to ResearchGate for hosting this first edition!</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":52.530799865722656,"address1":"Invalidenstr. 115","address2":null,"name":"ResearchGate","postalCode":null,"lon":13.384476661682129,"country":"de","city":"Berlin"},"utcOffset":3600000,"time":1418149800000,"title":"#1 => Erik Michaels-Ober on Soft Typing"},"246590181":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Berlin/events/246590181/","description":"<p>Alex Denisov will be presenting \"The Correctness-Security Gap in Compiler Optimization\" by Vijay D’Silva, Mathias Payer, and Dawn Song.<br/>Link to the paper: <a href=\"https://nebelwelt.net/publications/files/15LangSec.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://nebelwelt.net/publications/files/15LangSec.pdf</a></p> <p>There will be food and drink at the meetup this time!
