Being a “pure” language, Haskell was initially only capable of evaluating functions without side effects, which unfortunately ruled out all forms of interacting with the operating system (file IO, user input, user output, etc.). If you’ve ever included a “print” statement in a computer program, then you may be able to imagine the scope of this limitation. In fact, programs that can’t talk to the outside world are typically not very interesting, but Haskell overcame this hurdle via Wadler’s usage of the mathematical concept of the monad, which he describes in this paper.</p> <p>After their appearance in Haskell, Monads became hugely influential in functional programming and have since made appearances in a number of languages (Scheme, Racket, F#, Scala, Ocaml, Purescript, Agda, Idris), as well as in Functional Reactive Programming frameworks such as React, Elm, and Reflex. Various other examples also leap to mind, such as C#'s LINQ (written by Erik Meijer, who served as an editor for Wadler’s “Monads” paper). Indeed, there’s now an aura and mystery around the term monad and a lot of shared humor in the world of Functional Programming about the thousands of attempts to describe this potentially befuddling concept.</p> <p>In this talk we’ll go over Wadler’s famous paper, and try to evaluate the following questions:</p> <p>Why did they create a programming language with this problem? In other words, why “purity”? How does the monad work? Why is the solution interesting beyond the world of Haskell? Our talk will attempt to follow this rubric:</p> <p>A short history of Functional Programming and Haskell A intro to Lambda Calculus and Haskell Close reading of Sections 1 through 3 of the paper Light reading of Section 5 Note: we’re planning to skip over section 4 in the talk, but it is worth reading as another extended motivating example.</p> <p>Familiarity with Haskell is unnecessary for reading and discussing the paper. However, it can potentially make two aspects of the paper easier to understand: 1) the syntax used and 2) the problems that the paper is addressing. For anyone curious about trying some Haskell in preparation for reading this paper, I recommend the following path:</p> <p>Download the stack build tool:<br/><a href=\"https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/\"><a href=\"https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/</a><br/></a>Run “stack ghci” in a terminal to start up a Haskell REPL (this will probably take awhile and require a network connection the first time…)<br/>Run through sections 2 through 6 of Learn You a Haskell for Great Good (type out all the examples in your REPL):<br/><a href=\"http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out\"><a href=\"http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out\" class=\"linkified\">http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out</a></a></p> <p>Note: I recommend avoiding the section on monads in Learn You a Haskell until after reading the Wadler paper. In fact, at this point, I’d try to avoid all discussions of monads until after reading the paper.</p> <p>\n\nStreet parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Why is the blockchain protocol considered secure enough that investors have poured billions of dollars into it and whole new industries have sprung up around it?

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues north of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

It was first published in The Atlantic in July 1945 and republished in an abridged version in September 1945—before and after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nStreet parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

Using examples taken from the diagrams vector graphics framework as a case study, I demonstrate the power and beauty of monoids for library design. The paper begins with an extremely simple model of diagrams and proceeds through a series of incremental variations, all related somehow to the central theme of monoids. Along the way, I illustrate the power of compositional semantics; why you should also pay attention to the monoid’s even humbler cousin, the semigroup; monoid homomorphisms; and monoid actions.</p> <p>\n\n\nStreet parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usually easy at that hour.
