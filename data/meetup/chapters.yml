    description: <p>Building robust systems is an important part of software engineering. For various reasons, it's rarer than it should be. How can we improve as engineers to provide robust systems in a fast-paced environment?</p> <p>The wizard himself, Gerald Sussman, explores this topic by exploring how biological systems maintain functionality under the constant assault of everyday life. <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/robust-systems.pdf">Building Robust Systems</a> promises to be an interesting dive into two seemingly disparate worlds.</p> <p>The entrance on Cherry Street will probably be locked by the time we get setup. We have several different avenues for contacting us on <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/chattanooga">our PWL github</a> as well as being hooked into the Chadev slack. We'll also try and have someone at the door between 5:15 and 5:45 to let you in.</p>

    description: <p>In <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/Subtyping/">Subtyping vs. Subclassing</a>, Oleg Kiselyov addresses the separation of interface and implementation. The first section shows that in good object oriented design, the type system can't be used in general to decide whether implementations can be safely substituted for one another. In <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/Subtyping/Preventing-Trouble.html">Preventing Trouble</a>, he outlines a set of rules (in C++) that do allow the type system to enforce subtype relationships, and that look suspiciously familiar.</p> <p>Lang Martin is a Principal Software Engineer at OpenTable and renown thought-leader in the hand gesture space.</p>

      <p>Collecting real-time metrics like request latency is a critical part of production support. While it is easy to aggregate summary statistics like count, mean, and range, they are often a poor representation of actual service performance. This paper [1] describes a data structure that efficiently and accurately represents a histogram, which can be used to monitor and alert on quantile metrics (median, 99th percentile, etc.) in real time and constant space.</p> <p><br/>Brent Spell is a programmer at OpenTable in Chattanooga, where he works on infrastructure for distributed systems and machine learning applications for restaurants.</p> <p>

    description: <p>"The devil is in the [implementation]". In today's distributed system world of hip marketing and product-pushing companies with smooth-sounding tools digital solution descriptions are often a few sentences in a tweet or a simple proof on the back of a napkin. But are these candy-prescriptions actually easy to implement? This paper tells of the joys and fears confronted by the Google team who built Chubby, an implementation of Paxos.</p> <p>Jacob left the world of liberal arts at a mature age to follow the bread-crumb trail of programming theory. He cut his teeth on lisp dialects decades after they were forgotten, grew a large mustache to earn respect, and at one point thought all objects were immutable. Today he alternates between being lost in Clojure or in some new beer, and works for Opentable as a Software Engineer.</p> <p><a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/08w-dsi/chandra07paxos.pdf">Paxos Made Live Paper</a></p>

    description: '<p>Old ideas have a way of re-emerging in the field of computer
      science. One of these ideas that''s coming back around is CQRS. The short version
      is that by separating the write responsibilities from the read responsibilities
      you can more accurately capture the domain model. Unsurprisingly, things like
      REST aren''t very good at modeling the behaviors of a diverse set of behaviors/users.</p>

      <p>Recent advances in AI have yielded some impressive results. The use of deep neural networks in particular have led to astounding gains; machines have now approached or surpassed human ability at tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games.</p> <p>Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. Humans still excel at learning quickly from only a handful of examples, and applying knowledge to novel situations.</p> <p>Can reverse engineering human intelligence usefully inform AI and machine learning? The authors believe so, and offer a set of core ingredients that could pave the way for even more human-like, and powerful, AI.</p> <p>Stephen Spalding is a technologist, cyclist, and Chattanooga native. Over his professional career, he’s enjoyed working with 3d x-ray machines at GE Healthcare, nuclear reactors at TVA, Clojure services at OpenTable, and serving tables at Boathouse Rotisserie. Recently, he has joined the engineering team at Netflix to help deliver continuous streams of entertainment for more compliant humans, amenable to our robot overlords.</p> <p>

    description: <p>In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work, the authors attempt to bridge the gap between supervised learning and unsupervised learning using CNNs.</p> <p>This paper introduces the concept of DCGANs, which are neural networks that are trained to distinguish interesting structures and meaning from raw image data by competing with one another. In particular, the networks that are presented appear to be a strong candidate set for unsupervised learning of features for use in realistic image generation.&gt;&gt;We’ll explore convincing evidence that the DCGAN pair used here learns a hierarchical representation of the features held within images ranging from objects to entire scenes. Additionally, we’ll explore the use of these learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as generic image representations.</p> <p><br/>Matt Hardwick is a software engineer with 10+ years of experience creating software systems in various industries, including defense simulations and web-based applications. He currently leads an engineering team at Bellhops using technology to improve the way that people move from place to place. His recent software interests are Machine Learning and Elixir.</p> <p>Paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf">Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks</a></p>

    description: <p>Property testing has risen to popularity in the past years due to its ability to find edge cases and other hard to reproduce bugs. But for programmers new to property testing it can be difficult to see how to use property tests to exercise entire systems.</p> <p>In this paper we'll look at a real world use case for property tests and examine the tools and techniques used by the authors to find and reliably reproduce race conditions in a concurrent, distributed system.</p> <p>Chris is a software engineer building services and applications for Le Tote.  Although he started out writing C for embedded systems, these days he spends his time in Elixir, Haskell, Elm, and Rust.  When not writing code for work, Chris can be found writing code for fun, talking about the joys of functional programming, playing pinball, roasting coffee, or building lego with his kids.</p> <p><br/><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.724.3518&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Link to Paper</a></p>

Coopher, A. Guha, S. Krishnamurthi, J. McCarthy and R. Findler.</p> <p>

      ***</p> <p>

      The paper covers the issues with teaching Garbage Collection in an academic setting and the pitfalls around existing solutions. In an effort to remove obstacles that prevented students from implementing they have built a system that aids in the implementation of Garbage Collectors.</p> <p>

      Along with presenting the paper, Chris will explain garbage collection, collector techniques as well as the collector and mutator "languages" built by the authors. The system is <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/plai/collector.html">publicly available</a> and you can see a number of <a href="https://github.com/plt/racket/blob/84de4fd8e3a60254a7653fa90c80e9c4ec2bdca8/pkgs/plai/tests/gc/good-collectors/good-collector.rkt">collector implementations</a> that you can use to experiment within Dr. Racket.</p> <p>

      CRDTs. A CRDT is a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.
      Replicas of a CRDT eventually converge without any complex concurrency control.
      As an existence proof, the authors exhibit a non-trivial CRDT: a shared edit
      buffer called Treedoc. They outline the design, implementation and performance
      of Treedoc. They discuss how the CRDT concept can be generalised, and its limitations.</p>

This paper illustrates how all three operations fall under a common pattern of operations which perform algorithmically worse when left-associated (as opposed to when right-associated). Continuation passing style (CPS) is a well known cure to this problem, but the advantages dwindle when we have to observe/modify intermediate results before continuing with the rest of the "build" operations (list append etc).</p> <p>This paper presents a solution which is just as general as CPS, but which doesn't fall victim to the same limitation. This talk will focus on illustrating the root cause of the problem and the essence of the solution. The talk will borrow haskell code examples from the paper but knowledge of haskell will not be presupposed.

      the Meta-Level: PyPy’s Tracing JIT Compiler</a> by Carl Friedrich Bolz, Antonio
      Cuni, Maciej Fijalkowski, and Armin Rigo.</p> <p><br/>***</p> <p>Writing an
      interpreter for a language is a great way to quickly explore new ideas and create
      domain specific languages (DSLs).  Interpreted languages are both prevalent
      and incredibly popular, however the common perception is that choosing an interpreted
      language over a compiled language will always comes with a performance cost.
       In this talk, Scott will provide a high level introduction to the RPython toolchain
      for writing high performance interpreters in the context of PyPy the high performance
      Python interpreter built with RPython.  </p> <p>RPython stands for restricted
      Python; it is both a restricted subset of the Python language and a toolchain
      for developing interpreters.  RPython''s speed comes from a technique known
      as Tracing-JIT compilation which has been applied to many different languages;
      though perhaps most successfully with Lua and Python, where tracing-JITs underlie
      two high performance interpreter implementations; LuaJIT and PyPy respectively.</p>
      <p>The RPython toolchain takes the Tracing-JIT approach and abstracts it over
      languages.  That is rather than trying to speed up the programs of one language,
      it aims to provide a toolchain such that for any language; when you implement
      the interpreter for that language with RPython, you can then compile a version
      of your interpreter augmented with a tracing-JIT compiler.  This is very attractive
      since it means you can write a relatively simple but inefficient interpreter
      and by guiding the tracing-JIT process you can compile out much of the inefficiency
      and arrive at an efficient compiled version of your interpreter.</p> <p>Paper

      <p>Scott is a software generalist who aims his creative energies wherever interesting
      problems are to be found.  Currently he works at the intersection of programming
      language design and machine learning, but in the past he has worked on an eclectic
      mix of topics; including computer graphics, circuit simulation, distributed
      storage, and at one point in grad school trying to simulate the flow of bubbles
      when you pour out a pint of Guinness (It''s really neat to watch!).   Recently
      he has become fascinated with developing mini languages and interpreters for
      fun and maybe even some utility.  If this seems interesting to you, feel free

By the 1980s, Brian Sheppard had created a computer program, Maven, that revolutionized how even expert players played Scrabble. In between, where you find our story, Andrew W. Appel and Guy J. Jacobson published an architectural expose of how they had wrangled the nearly-infinite possibilities of "searching for the best word" into an artificial intelligence. One that could do it in real-time. Computers are now a trillion times larger, and 100,000 times faster than they were then. But it is revealing how mankind first got "intelligence" across the threshold.</p> <p>Paper link: <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf"><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf</a></a></p> <p>&lt;a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>Doors open at 6:30 pm, presentation will begin at 7:00 pm.</b> There will be food and refreshments provided by Shopify. </p> <p><br/>***</p> <p>Duffy O'Craven has been programming professionally since 1980 and during that long career saw things like the invention of C++ and Python.

    description: '<p><b>From System F to Typed Assembly Language </b></p> <p>by Greg
      Morrisett, David Walker, Karl Crary and Neal Glew</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>We
      motivate the design of a typed assembly language (TAL) and present a type-preserving
      translation from System F to TAL. The typed assembly language we present is
      based on a conventional RISC assembly language, but its static type system provides
      support for enforcing high-level language abstractions, such as closures, tuples,
      and user-defined abstract data types. The type system ensures that well-typed
      programs cannot violate these abstractions. In addition, the typing constructs
      admit many low-level compiler optimizations. Our translation to TAL is specified
      as a sequence of type-preserving transformations, including CPS and closure
      conversion phases; type-correct source programs are mapped to type-correct assembly
      language. A key contribution is an approach to polymorphic closure conversion
      that is considerably simpler than previous work. The compiler and typed assembly
      language provide a fully automatic way to produce certified code, suitable for
      use in systems where untrusted and potentially malicious code must be checked
      for safety before execution.</p> <p><b>Even though it is a technical paper,
      the lecture will not assume any background in programming language research
      or type systems from the audience.</b></p> <p><br/>Paper: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/papers/tal-toplas.pdf"><a

      <p>Unfortunately, getting to the Greenberg Lounge can be tricky. There are two
      ways to get there:</p> <p><br/>1. Most dependable: Levine Hall entrance. This
      seems to be the entrance closest to Greenberg Lounge that won''t be locked.
      Enter “3300 Chancellor St, Philadelphia, PA 19104” into Google Maps and enter
      through this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Levine_Hall_(University_of_Pennsylvania)_-_IMG_6634.JPG">entrance</a>.
      Go straight, through the door that goes to the courtyard. Walk up the steps
      until you reach this <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~dfaced/directions/cafe_03a.png">door</a>.
      Then go straight and make a right. The lounge will then be on your right.</p>
      <p><br/>2. Closer but will be locked after 7PM: Skirkanich Entrance on S 33rd
      St. This <a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3411/3278952033_1828f2ce1d.jpg">entrance</a>
      will be easier to find. I''ll be there to let people in until 7PM when the talk
      will start. <br/>If anyone has trouble getting to Greenberg Lounge, please post
      on the meetup page. I''ll be checking it frequently.</p> <p><br/><b>Food and

      <p>Excerpt from Kevin:</p> <p>Yes the title sounds all biologyish-chemistryish but it's really a theoretical biology paper, which mostly means building fairly simple mathematical models of physical processes (with some numerical simulations). Parts of it are mathematically challenging but those parts can be glossed over without missing much.</p> <p>If you look at the paper and it's too scary, don't worry. I'll do my best to explain what I love about this paper, but maybe you can read this 2-page review? If it doesn't hook you then you have no soul: <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/PKM%20publications/172.pdf"><a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/PKM%20publications/172.pdf" class="linkified">https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/PKM%20publications/172.pdf</a></a></p> <p>

You can download a copy of the paper <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~liljanab/MATH508/KoblitzEmbedding.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>--- </p> <p>A message from Kyle Pointer:</p> <p>Anyone who is interested in better understanding some of the math behind this paper might be interested in the book Algebraic Aspects of Cryptography[1], also written by Neal Koblitz. It contains a LOT of background that is useful in understanding the paper. Many of the details that are left out of the paper are covered somewhere in this relatively short text. </p> <p>And, for the true math heroes among you who, I can suggest you check out Koblitz's Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms[2].</p> <p>AND, just in case you want to have a book that your friends will think covers an oddly specific topic, Alex (who was at our last meeting) suggested the book Rational Points on Elliptic Curves[3] to me, and I've been enjoying it quite a bit as well.</p> <p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have to frantically struggle through a lot of math that I don't understand yet so that I can give a presentation with minimal hand-waving!</p> <p>[1] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Cryptography-Algorithms-Computation-Mathematics/dp/3540634460/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440728993&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=algebraic+aspects+of+cryptography"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Cryptography-Algorithms-Computation-Mathematics/dp/3540634460/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440728993&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=algebraic+aspects+of+cryptography" class="linkified">http://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Cryptography-Algorithms-Computation-Mathematics/dp/3540634460/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440728993&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=algebraic+aspects+of+cryptography</a></a></p> <p>[2] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elliptic-Modular-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387979662/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440729392&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=introduction+to+elliptic+curves+and+modular+forms"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elliptic-Modular-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387979662/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440729392&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=introduction+to+elliptic+curves+and+modular+forms" class="linkified">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elliptic-Modular-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387979662/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440729392&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=introduction+to+elliptic+curves+and+modular+forms</a></a></p> <p>[3] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Points-Elliptic-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/331918587X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440729461&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=rational+points+on+elliptic+curves"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Points-Elliptic-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/331918587X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440729461&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=rational+points+on+elliptic+curves" class="linkified">http://www.amazon.com/Rational-Points-Elliptic-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/331918587X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440729461&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=rational+points+on+elliptic+curves</a></a></p>

    description: <p>This will start with a brief introduction to differential expression analysis. This is the approach of comparing gene expression in two or more tissue samples to compare the way genes are expressed in various conditions. This will cover the basic principle, caveats, and a couple different approaches. </p> <p><br/>The second part will focus on one particular method for expression analysis, as developed by the Pachter Lab at UC Berkeley. They have used a newer method of assigning RNA-Seq reads to the correct locations of the genome. The RNA-Seq quantification is handled by the program kallisto, and the differential expression is performed by sleuth.</p> <p>Web Pages for the tools:</p> <p><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.html"><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.htm" class="linkified">http://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about.htm</a></a>l</p> <p><br/><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/about.html"><a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/about.html" class="linkified">http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/about.html</a></a></p> <p><br/>The paper itself:</p> <p><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02710v2.pdf"><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02710v2.pdf" class="linkified">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02710v2.pdf</a></a></p>

    description: <p>Arrow's impossibility theorem is the original, seminal example of a "voting paradox" that limits how "nicely" a method of producing a group decision from individual preferences (like voting) can behave.  Specifically, the theorem describes 4 properties that we'd all like our voting system to have and states that no voting system can have all these properties at once.</p> <p>The beauty of the theorem is how easily it can be tied to common frustrations of democratic politics.  I will start by giving a few historical examples of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (the most interesting of the aforementioned 4 properties) in action.  I will then give a simplified toy proof of the theorem posed via a game in which one voter does their best to troll another.  Finally, I will blast off into outer space and discuss esoteric and impractical topics like set theory and ultrafilter voting.   </p> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Wikipedia article</a> on the topic provides a nice introduction while these <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~dquint/econ698/lecture%202.pdf">lecture notes</a> give some intuition for a proof.  For a deeper dive you can read <a href="http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2014/06/Arrow-Social-Choice-And-Individual-Values.pdf">Kenneth Arrow's original paper</a>.</p>

      <p>Here''s a taste of the paper from its introduction: "Designing, understanding,
      and reasoning about distributed systems can be complicated. The major complexities
      arise from the uncertainties inherent in the system, particularly with regard
      to message delivery and possible faulty or unexpected behavior of processors.
      A protocol must be designed (and proved!) to function correctly even if it is
      possible for messages to be lost, for messages to arrive out of order, or for
      some processor to fail."</p> <p>Please note that we''re at a new location this

    description: '<p>… in the presence of cyclodextrins: The use of maltosyl-β-cyclodextrin
      as secondary antioxidant.</p> <p>This month, Brian Kamusinga will be presenting
      a paper that just might have the longest title we''ve presented on so far!</p>
      <p>Here''s the abstract, and we''ll try to get a copy for the group later:</p>
      <p>"Enzymatic browning reactions limit the commercial shelf life of apple juice,
      so that colour preservation during storage is one of the main objectives of
      fruit processors. In this paper, the colour of fresh apple juice was evaluated
      in the presence of different types of cyclodextrins (CDs) (α-CD, β-CD, γ-CD
      and maltosyl-β-CD), compounds that bind or complex polyphenol oxidase substrates.
      The effectiveness of CDs as browning inhibitors was determined as the difference
      between the colours observed in the CD-treated sample and the controls, using
      the colour space CIE-L∗, a∗, b∗ system. Although the effect of CDs on apple
      juice enzymatic browning has been studied, the action mechanism involved remains
      a subject of controversy. In this work, we have kinetically modelled apple juice
      enzymatic browning in the absence and presence of maltosyl-β-CD. The complexation
      constant between the mixtures of diphenols present in apple juice and maltosyl-β-CD
      was calculated (Kc = 4.09 mM−1). Different concentrations of maltosyl-β-CD modified
      the evolution of lightness (L∗), total colour (ΔE∗) and hue angle (H∗) because
      of the higher affinity constant it shows for the compounds responsible for apple
      juice browning than do α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD. Moreover, in this paper we show
      that maltosyl-β-CD can enhance the ability of ascorbic acid to prevent the enzymatic
      browning due to the protective effect of maltosyl-β-CD against ascorbic acid
      oxidation. Hence, maltosyl-β-CD seems to act as a “secondary antioxidant”, reducing
      apple juice browning and enhancing the naturally occurring antioxidant capacity
      of a food."</p> <p>Remember that we recently changed our meetup location: Ultralinq
      will be hosting us at 9666 Olive Blvd. in Olivette. Once you arrive, use the
      elevator to get to the second floor. The Ultralinq office is directly in front
      of the elevator to the left. Look for the Ultralinq sign beside the open door.
      There is some construction around the building at the moment, but parking should
      be available on the south side of the 9666 Olive Blvd. building as well as the
      parking lot for the shopping center on the east side of the building. Both are
      accessible off of Newcastle Dr., which is on the east side of the building.</p>'

    description: '<p>A homomorphic encryption scheme is one that allows computations
      to be carried out on ciphertext.  The idea is the following: I have two integers
      a and b and I want to encrypt them in a special way, one that allows YOU to
      use ENCRYPT(a) and ENCRYPT(b) to compute a third value x such that DECRYPT(x)
      = a+b - in other words, you have computed a+b for me and I didn''t even have
      to tell you what a or b were!  Such a scheme would have a great many applications
      but the quest to construct one was mostly fruitless until just a few years ago.</p>
      <p>In my talk, I''ll start by explaining what a homomorphic encryption is, why
      the "fully" in my title is an important qualifier, and go into a few of the
      many reasons that homomorphic encryption is a big deal.  I will then talk a
      bit about recent progress in this area with specific focus on the  (linked)
      papers <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616.pdf">Fully Homomorphic Encryption
      over the Integers</a> and <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1540000/1536440/p169-gentry.pdf?ip=216.87.60.250&amp;id=1536440&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=3A61A10B4E441F1A%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=901995863&amp;CFTOKEN=78548022&amp;__acm__=1487449189_5e8916f27189b2b0d24e261bdee3aa92">Fully

    description: <p>In the spirit of April Fool's we'll be doing a slightly different format this month. This meeting will consist of 5 minute lightning talks on "papers I hate". The meaning of this is completely open to your own interpretation, but some possible ones could be:<br/>1) papers I "hate" -- A tongue in cheek roast of a paper you really like.<br/>2) "papers" I hate -- A talk on something you dislike that isn't really a paper, but is kind of one. This can be tongue in cheek or earnest.<br/>3) "papers I hate" -- A paper you actually dislike, but please keep it lighthearted.</p> <p>We're removing the rule that you can't speak on a paper you published. If you want to lovingly bash your own work and think it would be fun for all then go for it. Also, if you choose to reinterpret "papers" for your talk we can also loosen the rule that the paper should be published as it would not make sense otherwise.</p> <p>I apologize for the short notice on this change in format, but if you were in the meeting last month then you might have heard early rumblings of it.</p> <p>Please message one of the coordinators to let us know your talk so we have a rough approximation of how many people will be doing a talk.</p>

      we will discuss µKanren, a relational language in the family of miniKanren.
      We will discuss the basics of relational programming, variable binding, and
      the strategy that µKanren uses for backtracking. We will explore these concepts
      using elm-microkanren[2]. Finally, we will briefly cover the work needed to

      on our first meetup. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Gothenburg/members/91963582/">Víctor</a> will
      be presenting the paper to us.</p> <p>You can download the paper here: <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/plt/propositions-as-types.pdf?raw=true"><a

      <p>---------</p> <p><b>[UPDATE]</b> At the event:</p> <p>• You will be able
      to access WiFi on request. Just ask Victor or Nachi</p> <p><br/>• There aren''t
      many power slots in the conference room to plug your laptop.</p> <p>• There
      will be no food or drinks provided at the event. You can feel free to get something
      from the baguetteria nearby: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1187591749"><a
      href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1187591749" class="linkified">https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1187591749</a></a></p>
      <p>• It would be really nice if you have a copy of the paper for you to use
      as a reference during the talk (either on your laptop/phone, or printed).</p>
      <p>---------</p> <p><br/>Rough Agenda:</p> <p><br/>• 17:30 - Doors open</p>
      <p>• 17:45 - Welcome</p> <p>• 18:00 - Presentation</p> <p><br/>• 18:45 - Discussion</p>
      <p><br/>----------</p> <p>How does it work?</p> <p>We pick a paper and a speaker
      prior to the meetup. The speaker presents the paper, and the presentation is
      followed by a discussion where we discuss the ideas in the paper, it''s practical
      implications, related research, future work etc., You can show off some implementation
      or your thoughts on the paper. The event will be quite informal (you suit up
      at your own risk!) and can go on for about 1-2 hours.</p> <p>Wait, but why the
      **** ?!</p> <p>Because it''s fun to read papers and talk about it. The speaker
      walks us through the paper and it''s background, helps us understand the math
      and demystify the technical jargon. You learn a lot and also get different perspectives.
      Overall, its a great opportunity to know about different areas of research in
      computer science.</p> <p>Should I attend?</p> <p>Of course! The members are
      a blend of engineers, hackers, researchers and students. Irrespective of your
      background, you are welcome to attend and indulge in the science.</p> <p>Can
      I help?</p> <p>Was hoping you''d ask this one. Papers We Love is community driven,
      so you are welcome to start a discussion, present a paper, help organize or
      host a meetup. Currently, we are in *need* of a co-organizer to help us out.
      It would be fantastic if you speak Swedish. Please get in touch with the <a

    description: '<p>Alejandro Russo will give a talk on the paper "Two Can Keep a
      Secret, If One of Them Uses Haskell" authored by him!</p> <p>Alejandro Russo
      is an associate professor at Chalmers University of Technology working on the
      intersection of functional languages, security, and systems. He is the recipient
      of a Google Research Awards and several grants from the Swedish research agencies
      Vetenskapsrådet, STINT, and Barbro Osher foundation. Internationally, Prof.
      Russo worked on prestigious research institutions like Stanford University,
      where he was appointed visiting associate professor. His research ranges from
      foundational aspects of security to developing tools to secure software written
      in Haskell, Python, and JavaScript. ( <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/"
      class="linkified">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/</a> ).</p> <p>The paper
      presents a monadic API in Haskell which takes advantage of the type system to
      protect confidentiality of data. Since the API utilizes the type system of Haskell,
      it guarantees confidentially of data during compile time itself! It is very
      interesting to see how the information flow in the system is restricted even
      in the presence of computation with side-effects. You can read the paper online
      here: <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/publications_files/pearl-russo.pdf"
      class="linkified">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/publications_files/pearl-russo.pdf</a></p>
      <p>We''re very glad to have Alejandro give us a talk. Don''t miss out! :)</p>
      <p>About this event:</p> <p>• This is a cross-meetup event, which we''re doing
      along with the functional programming lovers at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/got-lambda/">Got.Lambda</a>
      (the Göteborg Functional programming group)!</p> <p>• Starting at 18:00, there
      will be a 45 min talk followed by a discussion (ranging from 15 to 30 minutes)
      where Alejandro will take questions.</p> <p>• As always, we expect you to read
      the paper before attending!</p> <p>To know more about Papers We Love in Gothenburg,

      <p><b>Equal Rights for Functional Objects, or, The More Things Change, the More they Stay the Same</b></p> <p>There are many ways of defining equality, particularly in a language which has both object-oriented and functional aspects. There's reference equality, numerical equality, shallow list equality, deep list equality, string equality, and even "fuzzy" floating-point equality. Which is the right to choose in any given situation? Which should i use for my equals() method on my custom object?</p> <p>This paper answers all of these questions, by taking a seemingly complex problem and revealing an underlying simplicity. It does this by defining one equality operation that works in any situation.</p> <p>The paper makes use of lisp syntax, but the ideas are applicable to most modern languages.</p> <p>

      <p>Ricardo Monti from Imperial College London will presenting Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers by Stephen Boyd, Neal Parikh, Eric Chu, Borja Peleato and Jonathan Eckstein.</p> <p><br/>Doors open at 6:30 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:00 pm.</p> <p>We hope that you'll take a look at <a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/admm_distr_stats.pdf">the paper</a> before the Meetup (and if you don't, no worries).</p> <p>



      Many modern statistics and machine learning problems can be recast as optimization problems where we look to minimize a convex objective function.</p> <p>The resulting objective function enforces a set of desirable properties which we wish our answer to possess: a popular example would be sparsity (i.e., we wish to obtain a sparse answer for reasons of interpretability or for other reasons).</p> <p>However, it is often the case that minimizing such objective functions is difficult. While there have been many solutions proposed in the literature, each of these tends to focus on a specific problem.</p> <p>The proposed paper describes a powerful optimization algorithm called the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) - a conceptually simple method with which to solve a wide range of convex optimization problems  in an "off-the-shelf" manner.</p> <p>The ADMM algorithm works by exploiting the separable structure of many objective functions. By splitting the objective into a likelihood term and a penalization term, it is able to iteratively minimize the objective function with respect to each. As it turns out, each of these optimization steps is usually much simpler than the original problem (and in many cases has a closed form solution!). As a result, complex, high-dimensional problems can be broken down into a series of simple, 1-dimensional problems.</p>

    description: <p>Relational programming, or logic programming, is a programming paradigm that exhibits remarkable and powerful properties, to the extent that its implementation seems frightfully daunting to the layman. µKanren is a minimal relational language that seeks to strip the paradigm down to its core, leaving us with a succinct, elegant and above all <i>simple</i> set of primitives on top of which we can rebuild even the most powerful relational constructs.</p> <p>In this talk, we will explore the µKanren language by implementing it from first principles in a simple functional programming language, going on to demonstrate how you can assemble these simple building blocks into a semblance of its richer parent, miniKanren, and maybe solve a logic puzzle or two to make sure it’s working as advertised.</p> <p>The µKanren paper, and the original µKanren implementation, were authored by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman. The paper is available at <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf"><a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf" class="linkified">http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf</a></a>, and the Scheme implementation at <a href="https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren"><a href="https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren" class="linkified">https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren</a></a>.</p> <p>About Bodil:<br/>A compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and a co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and the UK, mostly because she’s still learning how to stop.</p>

      <p> </p> <p>Bailis et al formalise "Read Atomic" isolation which is a database
      isolation level sufficient for many applications which make use of large,distributed
      databases in real world applications. They then show how to design a database
      system which provides this isolation level whilst allowing read, write and read/write
      transactions on data across multiple partitions: partitions which do not need
      to communicate with each other.This method is both performant and fairly portable
      to existing architectures and allows database authors to implement much stronger
      guarantees than are currently available from systems in use at companies such
      as Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo or Amazon.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this talk we will
      explore the contributions of this paper and how they can be used solve some

    description: <p>Oliver Charles presents <a href="https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/Kleisli.pdf">Conor McBride's "Kleisli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune"</a>. </p> <p><br/>For a long time, it wasn't clear how to get purely functional programs to actually "do" anything. Finally, a breakthrough came by sharing ideas from category theory to bring monads into functional programming, as a way to model and manage side effects. However, little has been done to ensure that entire interaction sequences <i>make sense</i>. For example, many functional programming languages will allow you to open a file handle, close it, and then try and read from it - clearly a nonsensical sequence of operations! In "Kleisli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune", Conor McBride shows us how we can borrow more ideas from the literature, introducing a new formulation of <i>indexed monads</i> - a structure with close connections to slice categories. Given these new tools, he demonstrates that these monads can correspond to enforcing logical properties - following in the tradition of propositions-as-types, we now have the ability to begin to encode Hoare logic pre- and post-conditions on our programs.</p> <p><br/>About Oliver:</p> <p>Ollie has always had an interest in functional programming and correctness from a very early age - puzzled by how easy it seemed to make things go wrong, even by accident! Currently, he's the lead Haskell developer at the London startup Fynder, and spends the rest of his free time either working on open-source Haskell libraries, or exploring the latest functional programming research. One day, he hope's write software he can truly believe in, but there's a long way to go...</p>

It states that in a linearizable database, if the network is interrupted, some nodes cannot respond to requests. Although being able to tolerate network faults is important, the performance and response times of a database are often even more important, and CAP says nothing about those. It's also a pretty boring theorem.</p> <p>Attiya and Welch's paper, which we'll discuss in this session, is vastly more interesting. It also proves an impossibility result, but it's about response times: on a network where the uncertainty of packet delay is u, there is no algorithm that implements linearizability with read requests faster than u/4 and write requests faster than u/2. On a network where packet delay is highly variable (like many computer networks), a linearizable database is therefore inevitably going to be slow.</p> <p>The paper then goes on to compare linearizability to sequential consistency (a weaker consistency guarantee), and shows that sequential consistency can be significantly faster.</p> <p>This is a theoretical paper, but its applications to practical systems are very real. Its proofs are elegant and not too difficult to follow. It was almost a decade ahead of the CAP theorem. And moreover, it has no male co-authors. What's not to love about it?</p> <p>

Before that she was a Haskell developer for a Swedish e-signing startup, and before that she was a developer for a variety of financial institutions. She lives in London, and likes gardening and hanging out with her cat Albertina.</p> <p><b>The Paper:</b></p> <p>Leslie Lamport. 1998.

Cassandra uses it for <a href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/lightweight-transactions-in-cassandra-2-0">transactions</a>, <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Zab+vs.+Paxos">zookeeper</a>'s Zab is based on it. This was the original paper that introduced it.</p> <p>The Part Time Parliament paper is utterly charming and very funny (when you’re in on the joke). It’s written in the style of an archeologist uncovering the workings of the parliament of the ancient civilisation of the island of Paxos. The implications for computer science are left until the end of the paper.</p> <p>The paper had a bumpy road to recognition, originally written in 1989, it was initially quite misunderstood - we’re going to look a bit more at its history.</p> <p>We will be discussing the nature of the parliament of ancient Paxos, and how this relates to distributed systems. We’ll then look at second section of the paper that discusses how the ancient Paxos synod worked. The synod algorithm sits at the heart of the Paxos algorithm, so understanding this is a key piece of understanding the whole thing.</p> <p>We won’t be looking at the rest of the paper, and Paxos algorithm, because it’s very long and complicated, and honestly I don’t understand it (yet) - Paxos is notoriously hard to understand and implement. But hopefully everyone will enjoy finding out about this creative and fun paper, and will come out with a solid understanding at least part of the algorithm.</p> <p>As it is at Skills Matter, please sign up with them also <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7399-emily-green-on-the-part-time-parliament-paxos"><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7399-emily-green-on-the-part-time-parliament-paxos" class="linkified">https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7399-emily-green-on-the-part-time-parliament-paxos</a></a></p>

      <p>The widespread adoption of high­throughput sequencing machinery has produced
      an unprecedented amount of genomic data for biologists to analyse. To fully
      leverage the potential patterns hidden in the petabytes of DNA and RNA sequence
      information requires the use of machine learning algorithms and specialised
      kernels, which can capture the valuable domain knowledge provided by biological
      scientists. A common problem in computational biology is that of binary classification.
      Support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved good results in this domain and
      have thus been eagerly adopted by computational biology researchers. Ben­Hur
      et al provide a gentle introduction to support vector machines and kernels in
      the context of binary biological prediction problems.</p> <p>To explain the
      concepts of large margin separation and kernel functions, Ben­Hur et al use
      a computational biology problem known as splice­site recognition. In eukaryotic
      organisms, the process of gene expression involves transcribing a sequence of
      DNA into a molecule known as premature mRNA. Premature mRNA contains two types
      of regions: coding regions known as exons and ''junk'' regions known as introns.
      The boundary of these two sites is often recognized by the presence of specific
      dimers GT and AG at these sites. However, only 0.1%–1% of occurrences of these
      dimers in the genome represent true locations of splice sites, which leads to
      an interesting question: Can we use support vector machines to help classify
      sites as splice sites and non­splice sites?</p> <p>Ben­Hur et al explain the
      principles of maximum margin separation, kernel functions and classifier performance
      by exploring various aspects of this question. The paper is a great and gentle
      introduction into the world of support vector machines and also gives insight
      into some cool applications of machine learning technology. Moreover all of
      the data and code used in the paper is open­source. In six words: this is a
      paper to love!</p>'

Most useful non-blob data written to disk is probably in an RDBMS somewhere. But in 1970, all relational meant was "somebody had written a weird paper". System R was the research project that took that paper and made it of huge practical importance. On the way, the team discovered dozens of new research areas, techniques for database implementation, and ultimately made relational databases into the success they are today. Thousands of papers, and billions of dollars of investment are based off this one project, done by a team of 15 people. Many of the techniques invented are now taken for granted, just "normal" for line-of-business programmers.</p> <p>This is a survey, of a survey paper, of a large and long running research project. System R produced dozens of interesting papers, and we'll touch on the important topics, and reflect a bit on where we stand, 35 years after this paper was published.</p>

Deployment is not often seen as an academic topic, but the reason I like this thesis is because it takes an academic approach of defining the problem carefully and choosing the correct abstractions, and in doing so enables the application of knowledge from other areas such as memory management and memoization to the seemingly unrelated field of deployment.</p> <p>The thesis collects the theoretical ideas together into a practical tool called nix, a package manager which is still in use today. </p> <p>You don't need to read the whole thesis for this talk!  It would be more than enough to read just Part 1 (ie chapters 1 and 2). Chapter 1 states the problem and reviews previous work, including other package managers. Chapter 2 gives a brief overview of the whole nix system.</p> <p><br/>Eelco Dolstra.

      Certain papers change your life. McCarthy’s ‘Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and their Computation by Machine (Part I)’ (1960) changed mine, and so did Landin’s ‘The Next 700 Programming Languages’ (1966). And I remember the moment, halfway through my graduate career, when Guy Steele handed me Reynolds’s ‘Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages’ (1972).</p> <p>It is now common to explicate the structure of a programming language by presenting an interpreter for that language. If the language interpreted is the same as the language doing the interpreting, the interpreter is called <i>meta-circular</i>. </p> <p>Interpreters may be written at differing levels of detail, to explicate different implementation strategies. For instance, the interpreter may be written in a <i>continuation-passing style</i>; or some of the higher-order functions may be represented explicitly using data-structures, via <i>defunctionalisation</i>. </p> <p>More elaborate interpreters may be derived from simpler versions, thus providing a methodology for discovering an implementation strategy and showing it correct. Each of these techniques has become a mainstay of the study of programming languages, and all of them were introduced in this single paper by Reynolds.</p>

    description: <p>What happened in the basements of the AI lab at MIT in the late '50 is truly inspiring and this paper is telling us that story. Herbert Stoyan spent many years researching those early days and even McCarthy is pointing at his work in his papers!</p> <p><br/>Lisp is one of the oldest languages out there. When I started learning about functional programming, I got interested in why Lisp languages are what they are today, what's the relationship with AI, what lambda calculus has to do with this, or why I kept hearing things like "Lisp has failed".</p> <p>Surprisingly, many concepts that we give for granted in functional programming today were there almost 60 years ago! </p> <p>The paper is quite accessible and a good start for the new season of PWL. Some Lisp sources will be presented but there is no need to have a deep knowledge of the language. An html version of the paper is available at </p> <p>&lt;a&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050405213907/http://www8.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/html/lisp/histlit1.html&lt;/a&gt" class="linkified">https://web.archive.org/web/20050405213907/http://www8.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/html/lisp/histlit1.html&lt;/a&gt</a>; </p> <p>uSwitch is providing pizza and beverages.

    description: <p><b>The paper:</b></p> <p>Bryan Ford's 2002 Masters Thesis is remarkable in that it breaks decades of compiler-construction dogma with some simple principles and a compelling alternative to the complexity of parsing with context-free grammars (CFGs). He reveals a forgotten class of grammars-- top-down parsing language (TDPL), and some extensions known as parsing-expression grammars (PEGS) -- that directly correspond to the parsers that implement them. His primary contribution, however, is applying modern functional programming techniques of laziness and algebraic data structures to make TDPL/PEG parsers computationally efficient.</p> <p>The paper can be found here: <a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf"><a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf" class="linkified">http://bford.info/pub/lang/thesis.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b>About our speaker:</b></p> <p>Sean Cribbs is a Software Engineer at Basho Technologies, where he has contributed to many aspects of Riak, the distributed database and regularly hacks in Erlang, Python, Ruby and JavaScript. Prior to Basho, Sean was a freelance developer and consultant who also managed the development of the open-source Radiant web publishing system. Sean enjoys playing the piano in his free time.</p>

    description: <p><b>The Paper:</b></p> <p>The probabilistic test for primality presented in Michael Rabin's 1977 paper is interesting because prime numbers are at the center of several high-profile algorithm problems, and because probabilistic "proofs" in general challenge naive notions of mathematical certainty.

    description: <p><b>The Paper:<br/></b> As the first published paper describing the Lisp language, John McCarthy's 1960 paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions..." introduces some familiar, and some maybe not familiar concepts of Lisp in their earliest form. This talk will take a look at concepts like M-expressions, S-expressions, functions, and forms, and will walk through McCarthy's definitions of core Lisp functions like apply and eval. We'll also discuss the paper's description of the computer representation and translation of Lisp and recursive functions.</p> <p>The paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/raw/master/comp_sci_fundamentals_and_history/recursive-functions-of-symbolic-expressions-and-their-computation-by-machine-parti.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p><b>The Speaker:</b><br/>Kevin Buchanan is a software developer at 8th Light, where he currently enjoys getting to write Lisp with Clojure every day.</p>

A central assumption of the Naive Bayes classifier is the assumption that each predictor, or piece of evidence observed, is independent of other predictors. Given this simplicity (the 'naive' assumption) Naive Bayes classifiers have been shown to outperform other more sophisticated classifiers. We'll review what types of data attributes Rish argues can impact the performance of Naive Bayes as well as review an implementation in Python I wrote.</p> <p><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf"><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/Rish.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/><b>The Speaker:</b><br/>Given that Lorena was a policy analyst what is the likelihood that yes she would want to learn about modeling data? (The overwhelming likelihood says yes - she does.) During the day Lorena works as a software engineer at Sprout Social and by night, she likes to read papers like this one (as well as play Mortal Kombat and/or watch way too much Star Trek). Oh, and if you're a data enthusiast too, tell Lorena you want to try out a Kaggle challenge with her. She is really into the idea of predicting altruism through free pizza (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza"><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza" class="linkified">https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza</a></a>).</p>

      <p><b>The Paper:<br/></b>A description of 北斎 Hokusai, a real time system which is able to capture frequency information for streams of arbitrary sequences of symbols. The algorithm uses the CountMin sketch as its basis and exploits the fact that sketching is linear. It provides real time statistics of arbitrary events, e.g. streams of queries as a function of time. We use a factorizing approximation to provide point estimates at arbitrary (time, item) combinations. Queries can be answered in constant time.</p> <p><a href="http://www.auai.org/uai2012/papers/231.pdf"><a href="http://www.auai.org/uai2012/papers/231.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.auai.org/uai2012/papers/231.pdf</a></a></p> <p>

      <p><b>Schedule: <br/>6:00-6:30</b> Food and Socializing <br/><b>6:30-7:30 </b>Presentation and Discussion</p> <p><b>The Paper</b><br/>The problem of group membership in a networked distributed system can be expressed as the ability to reliably and repeatedly provide the answer a simple question: "who is alive?". </p> <p>Group membership represents a key part of many useful applications, including P2P systems, network overlays, service discovery, and HA clustering. The SWIM protocol addresses severe limitations in the scalability of existing heartbeat-based broadcast membership algorithms by introducing a new approach using weakly-consistent, gossip based information sharing. </p> <p>We'll start by working to understand the general problem space of group membership. Then we'll walk through the details of heartbeat-based membership algorithms and discuss their limitations when it comes to scalability. Once we have a grounding in the domain, we'll talk about the details of the SWIM protocol along with the benefits it provides and the tradeoffs of its strategy. </p> <p>We'll conclude with some discussion of a real-world implementation of SWIM in the Serf project and the role it plays in the Consul service discovery tool.</p> <p><br/><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf"><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf</a></a></p> <p>

      words:  "<i>It''s a very short physics paper--a sidenote, really, to work he

      sidenote his defining work--it gave rise to one of the weirdest physics phenomena
      ever, and has only gotten *more* confusing since the original proof. There''s
      a really interesting history behind it that reveals some of the sociology of
      academia. Plus it''s just fucking fascinating physics.</i></p> <p><i>It also
      doesn''t require any math beyond, say, high school calculus, but illustrates
      what a rigorous formal argument looks like--and I''m well-prepared to teach
      the math and concepts to an audience without any mathematical expertise. I think
      it''d be a really interesting contrast to some of the more industry-oriented
      papers we''ve seen recently.</i></p> <p><i>The value here isn''t in direct applicability

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/leifwalsh">Leif Walsh</a> , engineer at <a href="http://www.tokutek.com/">Tokutek</a> (and from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love">PWL NYC</a>), comes to visit us! Leif will present the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/data_structures/level-ancestor-simplified.pdf">Level Ancestor Simplified</a> paper by Bender and Farach-Colton.</p> <p>Leif tells us: " My favorite problems are always those with the highest ratio of difficulty in solving to difficulty in stating.  The <i>lowest common ancestor</i> problem exemplifies this.  It was first stated in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800125.804056">1973</a>, and can be described to anyone in two sentences, or with one sentence and a picture.  But it took 11 years before an optimal solution was discovered, and another 16 before an understandable and implementable solution with the same bounds was presented, in this paper, <i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i>.  This problem is furthermore satisfying because its bounds are so tight: pre-processing takes as long as just reading the input, and queries are constant time.</p> <p>


      <i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i> is a wonderfully curated journey through a deceptively simple problem that comes together in the end in a beautiful way, and it uses techniques that are powerful in plenty of other places.  Plus, it solves another bonus problem along the way!"</p> <p>


      <b>Note:</b> If you can't get enough of Tree Data Structures Leif will also be presenting on Wednesday, November 12 at Heavybit. RSVP here for:  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/TokuMX-SFO/events/201774892/">A Deep Dive on On-Disk Data Structures, B-Trees, LSM-Trees and Fractal Trees</a>. We hope to see you there too!!</p> <p>

      <p><a href="http://twitter.com/pbailis">Peter Bailis</a> presents the "Managing Update Conflicts in Bayou, A Weakly Connected Replicated Storage System" paper by Doug Terry, Marvin Theimer, Karin Petersen, Alan J. Demers, Mike J. Spreitzer, and Carl H. Hauser in SOSP 1995. <a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/bayou-sosp1995.pdf"><a href="http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/bayou-sosp1995.pdf" class="linkified">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/bayou-sosp1995.pdf</a></a></p> <p>

      Peter tells us: "A perennial challenge in managing shared, mutable state in distributed systems is the ability to permit concurrent writes while maintaining some degree of application "correctness." Bayou is an excellent and early example of an "optimistic" strategy for handling the concurrent update problem. Many of the techniques in Bayou---such as dependency tracking, application-specific merge procedures, and log shipping---are increasingly popular, can be found in systems like Dynamo, and help understand when and why mechanisms like CRDTs are useful."</p> <p> If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *github-thread* on the matter:  <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/193"><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/193" class="linkified">https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/193</a></a></p> <p>

Many modern networks have been greatly influenced by this design.</p> <p>Sargun Dhillon (<a href="https://gist.github.com/sargun/twitter.com/sargun">@sargun</a>) is highly interested in schemes for efficient, flexible computer networks to enable the next generation of applications. He currently works at <a href="http://mustwin.com/">MustWin</a>. He comes from an operations background, and spends much of his time thinking about how we can make distributed systems, networking, and databases friendlier to run.</p> <p>------------------</p> <p><b>Main Talk:</b></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/alexras">Alex Rasmussen</a> presents the "<a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/fds.pdf">Flat Datacenter Storage</a>" paper by Edmund B. Nightingale, Jeremy Elson,Jinliang Fan, Owen Hofmann, Jon Howell, and Yutaka Suzue. <a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/fds.pdf" class="linkified">http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2014/papers/fds.pdf</a></p> <p>Alex tells us: " Flat Datacenter Storage (FDS) is, as the intro describes, "a high-performance, fault-tolerant, large-scale, locality-oblivious blob store". It's also a great example of how carefully thought-out co-design of software and hardware for a target workload can yield really impressive performance results, even in the presence of heterogeneity and operating at scale. In my (admittedly biased) opinion, this style of system design doesn't get enough attention outside of academia, and has a lot to teach us about how data-intensive systems should be designed."</p> <p> If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *github-thread* on the matter: <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/198"><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/198" class="linkified">https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/198</a></a></p> <p>

      <p><b>PWL Minis</b></p> <p>

      We have two 5-7 minute talks before our main presentation where a short summary of a paper or an exciting idea is shared. Anyone can sign up for a mini, just email us!</p> <p>

      • Mini #1: <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdonica">Veronica Ray</a> on Experimenting At Scale With Google Chrome’s SSL Warning (<a href="http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/chi-ssl-experiment.pdf"><a href="http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/chi-ssl-experiment.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.adrienneporterfelt.com/chi-ssl-experiment.pdf</a></a>). From Veronica: "<i>Whether we are surfing the web or developing applications, browser security affects us all. This study from 2014 is the first to demonstrate why real users disregard browser security warnings. Its conclusions about the impact of warning design are surprising and inspire reflection about what we as developers can do to keep our users safe."</i></p> <p>

      • Mini #2: <a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/13353208602533882282">Gareth Morgan</a> on  The Rendering Equation (<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S08/lectures/kajiya.pdf"><a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S08/lectures/kajiya.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S08/lectures/kajiya.pdf</a></a>). From Gareth: <i>"</i><i>This paper is one of the most important 3D graphics papers in the subject's history.  It is the foundation of many of the rendering techniques used in modern graphics.  I will give a short overview of the rendering equation and why it is so important for 3D graphics.  This will be a taster of my full talk on this paper which I will be giving later in the year"</i></p> <p>






      <b>Main Talk</b></p> <p>


      <a href="https://twitter.com/caitiem20">Caitie McCaffrey</a> stops by and talks about the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/210931/Orleans-MSR-TR-2014-41.pdf">Orleans: Distributed Virtual Actors for Programmability and Scalability</a> paper by Bernstein, Bykov, Geller, Kliot, and Thelin.</p> <p>

      Orleans is a runtime and programming model for building scalable distributed systems, based on the actor model.  The Orleans programming model introduces the abstraction of Virtual Actors.  Orleans allows applications to obtain high performance, reliability, and scalability.  This technology was developed by the eXtreme Computing Group at Microsoft Research and was a core component of the Azure Services that supported that powered Halo 4, the award winning video game. </p> <p>

      <p><b>PWL Mini</b></p> <p><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/adereth">Matt Adereth</a> on "<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.30.5736">The Mode Tree: A Tool for Visualization of Nonparametric Density Features</a>"(<a href="http://adereth.github.io/oneoff/Mode%20Trees.pdf" class="linkified">http://adereth.github.io/oneoff/Mode%20Trees.pdf</a>).  From Matt: "<i>We often look at summaries of univariate data using basic descriptive statistics like mean and standard deviation and visualizations like histograms and box plots.  The Mode Tree is a powerful alternative visualization that reveals important details about our distributions that none of the standard approaches can show.</i></p> <p><i>I particularly like this paper because it was really the by-product of some interesting algorithmic work in Computational Statistics.  A lot of the techniques in this area are pretty math heavy and inaccessible, so I appreciated that they dedicated a paper to making a visualization that helps explain the inner workings.  As a bonus, the visualization stands on its own as a useful tool."</i></p> <p><b>Matt's Bio</b></p> <p>Matt Adereth builds tools and infrastructure for quantitative analysis at Two Sigma.  He previously worked at Microsoft on Visio, focusing on ways to connect data to shapes.</p> <p><br/><b>Main Talk </b></p> <p><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/armon">Armon Dadgar</a> from HashiCorp takes us on a deep dive of Bloom filters and HyperLogLog.</p> <p>Bloom filter papers:</p> <p>* <a href="http://www.cs.upc.edu/~diaz/p422-bloom.pdf"><a href="http://www.cs.upc.edu/~diaz/p422-bloom.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cs.upc.edu/~diaz/p422-bloom.pdf</a></a></p> <p>* <a href="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf"><a href="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf" class="linkified">http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf</a></a></p> <p>* <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Ekirsch/pubs/bbbf/esa06.pdf"><a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Ekirsch/pubs/bbbf/esa06.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Ekirsch/pubs/bbbf/esa06.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Armon will mostly touch on the first  paper which is the introduction of the technique. The other two are optimizations that he'll discuss briefly but there's no need to dwell on them.</p> <p>HyperLogLog papers:</p> <p>* <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.9475"><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.9475" class="linkified">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.9475</a></a></p> <p>* <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html"><a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html" class="linkified">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html</a></a></p> <p>Again, the first one introduces them, and the second one is some optimizations from Google. He won’t spend much time on the second one either.</p> <p>All of these papers are implemented as part of:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/armon/bloomd"><a href="https://github.com/armon/bloomd" class="linkified">https://github.com/armon/bloomd</a></a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/armon/hlld"><a href="https://github.com/armon/hlld" class="linkified">https://github.com/armon/hlld</a></a></p> <p>These links may give some context to the work and show the real-world applicability.</p> <p>From Armon on why he loves these papers: <i>"Bloom Filters and HyperLogLog are incredible for their simplicity and the seemingly impossible behavior they have. Both of them are part of the family of “sketching” data structures, which allow for a controllable error that results in a tremendous savings of memory compared to the equivalent exact implementations.</i></p> <p><i>More than just being elegant, these two data structures enable some very cool real-world use cases. In the online advertising company I previously worked for, we used them to track thousands of metrics across billions of data points comfortably in memory on a single machine. "</i></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><b>Armon's Bio</b></p> <p>Armon has a passion for distributed systems and their application to real world problems. He is currently the CTO of HashiCorp, where he brings distributed systems into the world of DevOps tooling. He has worked on Terraform, Consul, and Serf at HashiCorp, and maintains the Statsite and Bloomd OSS projects as well.</p> <p>

      <p><b>Mini</b></p> <p><a href="http://twitter.com/dijkstracula">Nathan Taylor</a> on "Your computer is already a distributed system. Why isn’t your OS?" (<a href="http://www.barrelfish.org/barrelfish_hotos09.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.barrelfish.org/barrelfish_hotos09.pdf</a>). </p> <p>From Nathan: <i>"This is one in a long line of papers advocating for a loosely-coupled, service-oriented operating system architecture, an argument that extends back to the dawn of systems research.  Alternative OSs like microkernels have long been considered more stable and easier to reason about by the systems community, but the performance overhead that comes with running them means typically our OSs still resemble the ones from the '60s.  The authors have spun the "it will be too slow" argument on its head by extrapolating hardware trends and adopting terminology from the distributed systems community, and end up making a compelling case for their design not only being the _only_ path forward, but the time is now to begin adopting their techniques.  The paper is punchy, argues its point cogently, and served as a springboard for further work by the same group of researchers."</i></p> <p>


      <b>Nathan's Bio</b></p> <p>Nathan is currently working on low-latency content distribution at <a href="http://www.fastly.com">Fastly</a> and has previously hacked on improving the performance of language runtimes and OS hypervisors.

      <b>Jordan's Bio</b></p> <p>Jordan West (@_jrwest) is a distributed systems practitioner and open source contributor with a passion for functional programming. He recently worked on the core distributed systems and key/value storage components of Riak, an open-source distributed datastore, implementing major features such as a new reliable broadcast protocol and replicated metadata store. He now spends time working on other distributed systems include Apache Cassandra. When not working on distributed databases or reading papers you can usually find Jordan outside with playing with his dogs. </p>

Though Spanner is ultimately a database, the greatest contributions of the paper are arguably more generally applicable, and I will try to focus on those aspects of the technology.</i></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Ben's Bio</b></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/el_bhs">Ben</a> is a cofounder at Resonance Labs, a pre-launch company working to transform the way that developers build, understand, and interact with distributed systems. Prior to starting that company, Ben spent nine years at Google, which he left as a senior staff engineer. During his tenure there, he led the design for several large (~1M-process) distributed systems. The most significant of these were Dapper, which is an always-on distributed tracing system, and Monarch, which is a high-availability timeseries collection, storage, and query system; both are important pieces of Google’s production infrastructure today.</p> <p>

These methods work via access to a kernel function, which can be thought of as a measure of similarity between two vectors. The standard method of optimization via kernels requires solving a program with decision variable the size of the number of data points. As dataset sizes grow, this becomes prohibitive.</p> <p>This paper addresses this issue in a surprisingly practical way. Specifically, the authors show that by using a multiple of d random projections based on the Fourier transform of the kernel function (where d is the ambient dimension), one can accurately approximate the kernel function. This allows practitioners to use fast linear solvers and retain the benefits of more expressive function classes.</p> <p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~stephentu/">Stephen</a> is a graduate student in EECS at UC Berkeley.</p> <p>

The paper demonstrates a new approach to analyzing programs where we can train statistical models to bound the error as tasks fail. This allows us to be more resilient in the face of system failures in many applications that can tolerate "good enough" results. This area of research is particularly dear to my heart as I was first exposed to it while taking a compiler engineering course at MIT which the author, Prof. Martin Rinard, taught.

      <p><b>****** We are closing the year with a PWL marathon ******</b></p> <p><br/><b>Talk #1 </b>- <a href="http://twitter.com/dijkstracula">Nathan Taylor</a> on " Corey: An Operating system for Many Cores" (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/boyd-wickizer/boyd_wickizer.pdf"><a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/boyd-wickizer/boyd_wickizer.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/boyd-wickizer/boyd_wickizer.pdf</a></a>) and "An analysis of Linux scalability to many cores" (<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/linux:osdi10.pdf"><a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/linux:osdi10.pdf" class="linkified">https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/linux:osdi10.pdf</a></a>)</p> <p><br/>From Nathan: </p> <p><br/>This is a story that spans two low-level systems papers. While on the surface it's all about how to make operating systems scale, it's also a story about how the same researchers can tackle a problem from different angles, succeed each time, and yet end up with very different conclusions. </p> <p>At OSDI '08 Silas Boyd-Swicker et al published <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/boyd-wickizer/boyd_wickizer.pdf">Corey: An Operating system for Many Cores</a>, which advocated for a fundamental restructuring of the operating system; they observed that scalability problems often manifest because of data unintentionally shared between CPUs, so their research OS provided improved abstractions for programmers to inform the kernel about what is supposed to be local to a particular core or thread.</p> <p>At the subsequent OSDI, though, the same research lab published <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/linux:osdi10.pdf">an analysis of Linux scalability to many cores</a>, where they present the same problem -- kernel scalability-- but instead tackled it by finding individual bottlenecks and implementing tiny point fixes, mostly-hidden from application code.  This inverted approach worked so well that in their abstract they arguably recanted the conclusion from their earlier work: "...there is no scalability reason to give up on traditional OS organizations yet."</p> <p>These papers, together, are interesting to me for a bunch of reasons.  The former advocates for better application control of data sharing by exposing new abstraction primitives, whereas the OS remains in the latter paper an opaque layer where we're to be mostly content at not having to look underneath the hood.  Seeing two seemingly opposing philosophies work equally well was a surprising result to me.  It's also interesting how the tacit assumptions we make can cause wildly different systems to be built.  In one, it's treated as axiomatic that a new software architecture is needed, whereas in the other the very first sentence questions the "traditional architectures don't scale" assumption.  And, of course, when so many people build careers out of asserting that There's Only One Way To Solve This Problem, it's refreshing to see the same group of researchers try different approaches in such quick succession.</p> <p>


      <b>Nathan's Bio</b></p> <p>Nathan is currently working on low-latency content distribution at <a href="http://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> and has previously hacked on improving the performance of language runtimes and OS hypervisors. His first exposure to OS research came as a graduate student at the University of British Columbia.</p> <p>


      <b>Talk#2 : Christopher Meiklejohn's A Brief History of Chain Replication</b></p> <p>Chain replication promises a high throughput, linearizable, robust replication technique with minimal overhead to tolerate failures with only f+1 nodes. But, what's the reason for so many systems choosing alternative techniques such as quorum-based or state machine replication? In this talk, we talk through a history of chain replication, starting with the original work from 2004 by van Renesse and Schneider. We will look at the various systems built using chain replication: Hibari, FAWN-KV, and CRAQ. We'll explore safer designs of chain replication, such as the elastic replication work in 2013, and finally look a new and unique designs of chain replication, such as Basho's Machi system. </p> <p><br/>The papers discussed in Chris's talk are:</p> <p>• Object Storage on CRAQ - <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf"><a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• FAWN: A Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes - <a href="http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/andersen-sosp09.pdf"><a href="http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/andersen-sosp09.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/andersen-sosp09.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• Chain Replication in Theory and in Practice - <a href="http://www.snookles.com/scott/publications/erlang2010-slf.pdf"><a href="http://www.snookles.com/scott/publications/erlang2010-slf.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.snookles.com/scott/publications/erlang2010-slf.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• HyperDex: A Distributed, Searchable Key-Value Store - <a href="http://hyperdex.org/papers/hyperdex.pdf"><a href="http://hyperdex.org/papers/hyperdex.pdf" class="linkified">http://hyperdex.org/papers/hyperdex.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• ChainReaction: a Causal+ ConsistentDatastore based on Chain Replication - <a href="http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Almeida.pdf"><a href="http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Almeida.pdf" class="linkified">http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Almeida.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• Leveraging Sharding in the Design ofScalable Replication Protocols - <a href="http://www.ymsir.com/papers/sharding-socc.pdf"><a href="http://www.ymsir.com/papers/sharding-socc.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.ymsir.com/papers/sharding-socc.pdf</a></a></p> <p>

The construction uses the wreath product, a coordinate system with unidirectional data flow among the factors, like addition with carry. How many group factors are needed? We don't know if this complexity question is decidable, after a half century of work. However, the effort has led to deep insights into regular languages, pseudovarieties (equational specifications of finite algebras), categories, and circuits.</p> <p>Recent work on distributed systems connects eventual consistency with monotonic operations. A special case of K-R shows that such operations are exactly what you can build from semilattices (commutative, idempotent semigroups, which are weaker than flip-flops) using wreath products.</p> <p><br/>[1] K.

      <p><b>Mini</b></p> <p>Lukasz Jagiello on “pASSWORD tYPOS and How to Correct Them Securely” (<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rahul/papers/pwtypos.pdf"><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rahul/papers/pwtypos.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rahul/papers/pwtypos.pdf</a></a>)</p> <p>Lukasz tells us: <i>“typo-tolerant password authentication for arbitrary user-selected passwords” sounds like a really bad security joke but if we combine that with metrics where almost 10% of failed login attempts fail due to a handful of simple, easily correctable typos, such as capitalization errors. Authors proves it is possible to improve user experience with really low impact on security.</i></p> <p><i>I really enjoy this paper because it’s not a standard security approach and in many places it’s a reasonable tradeoff between security and UX.  </i></p> <p>


      <b>Lukasz's Bio</b></p> <p>Lukasz Jagiello is an operations engineer at Wikia where he is hard working on saying NO. Between NO and NO he focus his work at modern approach to monitoring and distributed storage</p> <p>


      <b>Main Talk</b></p> <p>Shannon's “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” is one of those rare papers that defined an entire field of study. (In fact, a year later, it was republished as “THE Mathematical Theory of Communication.”) It provided a unified understanding of communication systems, pulling together work from disparate disciplines like physics, electronics and telegraphy. </p> <p>In this paper, Shannon demonstrates that information is a measurable quantity, and transmission of information can be optimized to achieve fundamental, previously unknown limits. It's one of those papers that underlies so much of modern information theory that the material feels intensely familiar to readers now. In addition, it has a bunch of fun tidbits, including the great-grandfather of ebooks Twitter accounts.</p> <p>I'll provide a quick history of the field before 1948, discuss the main results of the paper, and mention some of the fun (and occasionally counter-intuitive!) implications of the paper.</p> <p>[0] <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Shannon%20-%20A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication.pdf"><a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Shannon%20-%20A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication.pdf" class="linkified">http://worrydream.com/refs/Shannon%20-%20A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Kiran's Bio</b></p> <p>Kiran Bhattaram loves making things, whether tinkering with circuits, writing software systems, or sewing dresses.

More than a few understand the current state of the art: dotted version vectors and bounded version vectors. Paradoxically, almost everyone missed some of the more subtle concepts, and questions that Lamport introduced in this paper.</p> <p>In the intervening years. Progress has occurred, and the state of the art has evolved. This talk is therefore in three parts. The first being a review of the paper itself, the concepts it introduced, and the assumptions behind these concepts. The second part reflects what we’ve learned in the intervening years, and especially the relationship of Lamport’s (original) understanding of time, which was superior to almost all other computer scientists at the time, and what (in contrast) we know now. The third part will be entirely devoted to questions and answers: Where anyone can ask a question, and anyone can try to answer it. The speaker will try to answer the question if no one else wants to, or if the audience appears dissatisfied. The discussion is expected to be lively, insightful, and potentially, mind blowing.</p> <p>In order to prepare yourself for this talk. Anticipate there will come a point where you are asked to take a blue pill vs. a red pill.  If you watch these videos, your red pill transition will be gentler.  Most of you may prefer to take the blue pill and go back to your old way of thinking about time. In which case, you won’t find this talk very interesting, because of course you already know all the answers.</p> <p>Those who want to be more prepared for the red/blue pill experience, will benefit from both reading the paper, and watching the most recent PBS videos on the nature of spacetime:</p> <p>1. Does the Speed of Light have anything to do with light?   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo</a></a>   </p> <p>PBS Digital Studios.  A 12 minute and 45 second Red Pill: The Speed of Causality</p> <p>2.

This 1971 paper by David Parnas argues for using information-hiding as the basis for evaluating modularizations.

This paper takes a principled approach to understanding different garbage collection algorithms and offers something useful for both language implementors and programmers that use garbage-collected languages.</p> <p><br/><b>Spoon's Bio </b></p> <p>Spoons is a co-founder at LightStep, a company that makes complex microservice applications more transparent and reliable.

Spoons holds a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in Computer Science.</p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Main Talk</b></p> <p>Pat Helland on "Immutability Changes Everything"</p> <p><br/>There is an inexorable trend toward storing and sending immutable data. We <i>need immutability</i> to coordinate at a distance, and we <i>can afford immutability</i> as storage gets cheaper. This article is an amuse-bouche sampling the repeated patterns of computing that leverage immutability. Climbing up and down the compute stack really does yield a sense of déjà vu all over again.</p> <p><br/>It wasn’t that long ago that computation was expensive, disk storage was expensive, DRAM (dynamic random access memory) was expensive, but coordination with latches was cheap. Now all these have changed using cheap computation (with many-core), cheap commodity disks, and cheap DRAM and SSDs (solid-state drives), while coordination with latches has become harder because latch latency loses lots of instruction opportunities.  Keeping immutable copies of lots of data is now affordable, and one payoff is reduced coordination challenges.</p> <p>


      <b>Pat's Bio</b></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/pathelland">Pat Helland</a> has been working in distributed systems, databases, transaction processing, scalable systems, and fault tolerance since 1978. For most of the 1980s, Pat worked at Tandem Computers as the Chief Architect for TMF (Transaction Monitoring Facility), the transaction and recovery engine under NonStop SQL. After 3+ years designing a Cache Coherent Non-Uniform Memory Multiprocessor for HaL Computers (a subsidiary of Fujitsu), Pat moved to the Seattle area to work at Microsoft in 1994. There he was the architect for Microsoft Transaction Server, Distributed Transaction Coordinator, and a high performance messaging system called SQL Service Broker, which ships with SQL Server. From[masked], he was at Amazon working on the product catalog and other distributed systems projects including contributing to the original design for Dynamo. After returning to Microsoft in 2007, Pat worked on a number of projects including Cosmos, the scalable “Big Data” plumbing behind Bing. While working on Cosmos, Pat architected both a project to integrate database techniques into the massively parallel computations as well as a very high-throughput event processing engine. Since early 2012, Pat has worked at Salesforce.com in San Francisco. He is focusing on multi-tenanted database systems, scalable reliable infrastructure for storage, and software defined networking.</p>

      <p><b>Mini</b></p> <p>Aish Raj Dahal on "The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols"</p> <p>While it is easy to criticize the network stack for not being "web scale", the protocols that build the web, TCP/IP have been around for a while. The paper focuses on three main ideas behind the philosophy of the design of the Internet and protocols its built upon. David Clark highlights the reasoning around, how the basic ideas such as, datagrams, things that we take for granted today were carefully designed. From an engineering prospective, it provides a great retrospective analysis about building systems/protocols that last a generation.</p> <p>


      <b>Aish's Bio</b></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/aishrajdahal">Aish</a> is a software engineer with a passion for distributed systems. He currently works for PagerDuty, building reliable event driven systems. In the past life, he was at Wall Street building software platforms for high performance trade execution. He was also a maintainer for KDE's KGet project.</p> <p>


      <b>Main Talk</b></p> <p>Peter Geoghegan on "Query Evaluation Techniques for Large Databases"</p> <p>Peter tells us:  This talk takes some artistic license with the established PWL format. Rather than being a discussion of one particular paper, the talk is intended as a guided tour of the development of various widely implemented relational database join algorithms, with a particular focus on the pressures that shaped their development. Framing the discussion this way is not intended as a history lesson, so much as a vehicle for explaining the practical relevance of each algorithm under discussion, possible future developments, and the fundamental nature of how relational databases implement joins.</p> <p>That being said, the talk is essentially an exploration of the paper "Query Evaluation Techniques for Large Databases", by Goetz Graefe.</p> <p>The talk will make quite a few small detours, generally influenced by related papers, but without veering too far from Graefe's central arguments.</p> <p>Familiarity with working with systems like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle will give a good grounding for understanding the material in the talk. Reading over and working through the "Using EXPLAIN" [1] section of the PostgreSQL documentation may be a useful refresher on the topics the talks considers.</p> <p>[1] <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/using-explain.html"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/using-explain.html" class="linkified">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/using-explain.html</a></a></p> <p>

      <p><br/>More details:</p> <p>Many of you have mentioned about this clashing
      with a talk at FuConf on property-based testing but I suggest we go through
      with this because I not only plan to cover QuickCheck but also motivate the
      topic with a little generality with respect to functional programming (to cater
      to those with a background mainly in imperative languages). Here is an outline
      of things I will cover</p> <p>Each of these below will be illustrated with plenty
      of code examples</p> <p><br/>- Why are tests needed? This is not as obvious
      as it seems when viewed from the point-of-view of the Curry-Howard isomorphism
      (this will also serve as a hook for a future talk someone will inevitably want
      to do on type systems)</p> <p><br/>- How Haskell and other functional and type-safe
      languages can reduce testing needs</p> <p><br/>- What types can tell you about
      code functionality</p> <p>- Types can get you far but not totally... so testing
      begins. Starting with the familiar method of unit testing</p> <p>- An alternative
      mode of testing: invariance testing. Introducing QuickCheck. Include other motivations
      for invariance testing (from the model-checking world... successfully used in
      hardware and driver testing)</p> <p>- Work through the paper</p> <p>- Real-world
      uses of QuickCheck in Haskell packages (vector, lens, etc)</p> <p>- Integration
      with unit tests and cabal (if people are interested)</p> <p>- and ... pointing
      to further reading</p> <p>Let me know what you guys think.</p> <p>Thanks,</p>

    description: <p> Paxos and Raft are two algorithms for getting one answer from a group of unreliable processors. Some of the more popular use-cases for such algorithms are leader election, distributed locking, distributed log replication and so on.</p> <p>Paxos was originally presented by Leslie Lamport in a very entertaining paper (that was rejected for publication many times). However, generalized Paxos is considered extremely hard to implement. </p> <p>Raft was born as a easy to understand consensus algorithm and had several implementations to its credit. </p> <p>In this session, I am planning to go over the problem of distributed log replication, walk through Paxos and its derivatives and then go through Raft. We can take a quick shot at implementing it, if time permits. </p>

Bits represent state: each bit can be in 2 states, 10 bits in 1024 states, a 100 in 1e301 states. No matter whatever high level abstractions you create for talking about these primitive bits (floats, points, lines, boxes, polygons, fish), as long as you are writing programs that work with state, you are bound to run into this combinatorial explosion as you add complexity. We humans are really bad at keeping track of states in our heads! An average person can keep <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">7 ± 2</a> things in his/her working memory. What we are good at though, is <i>narratives and descriptions</i>...</p> <p><br/>The timeless paradigm of functional programming emphasizes thinking of programs as consisting of pure functions akin to mathematical identities. This decouples programming from the idea that programs have to be written for a computer, and as a series of instructions. Instead, in FP, we <i>describe</i> the world and the system we want to create in terms of its constituent parts, which, in turn, are similarly <i>described</i> in terms of their constituent parts.</p> <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p> <p>Peter Henderson's "Functional Geometry" simply provides an example of a well-written functional program. In particular, the author builds a sequence of functions which start off by describing lines on a 2D plane and build up to a description of an intricate <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/">Escher</a> woodcut called <a href="http://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/square-limit">Square Limit</a> (final result in the figure). In the process, the author offers insights into how to write other such well-written functional programs.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/0/a/600_432021002.jpeg" /></p> <p><i>                                    A 600x600 grid of bits!</i></p> <p><br/>In this session we can plan to discuss:</p> <p>

      • Primitives for describing geometry of lines on a 2D plane</p> <p>• <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node29.html">Abstraction barriers</a>, and layered design of a richer set of functions (the fish and its poses)</p> <p>• The description of Square Limit</p> <p>• An implementation of a system to draw the primitives</p> <p>• History of this paper, and how other notable works make references to it</p> <p>• (Discussion) concrete lessons you can apply in your day-to-day programming - I am expecting this discussion to be a blast!</p>

    description: <p>I will be talking about Hyperloglog, a cardinality (i.e. number of distinct elements) <i>estimation</i> algorithm. In general, counting the number of elements in a set gets harder as the number of sets increase. For e.g., you might want to count number of users from a country.. i.e. number of sets is just 200+ and you can use a map of country to count. But, if you want to count the number of unique visitors to a popular website, then the number of sets become really large.</p> <p>Probabilistic counting methods give a way to estimate the cardinality of sets without keeping track of every single item. Hyperloglog is probably the best known of those methods. </p> <p>Paper: <a href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf"><a href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf" class="linkified">http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf</a></a></p>

      <p>I plan to cover 2  papers. But the focus will definitely on the LSM-Tree paper.</p> <p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.44.2782&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">The Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree)</a></p> <p>

      As a brief intro will start with the B trees probably from (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=E387DEFF3E37473F46B8C83EDDE87E14?doi=10.1.1.96.6637&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">The ubiquitous B tree</a>)</p> <p>



      If people are intersted, I can show code for the some of the above.</p> <p>


      Some knowledge of Database Internals and some basic algorithms is expected.</p> <p><br/>The reason this paper is important, is because most modern databases use either of the two ways for storing data.</p> <p>I have started to create a Reading Helper for Reading the paper. It is here. If you are reading the paper and are confused about things  please make a comment and I will update it.</p> <p>

    description: <p>Shriram is back at Bangalore and has agreed to give a talk on 17th Jan, Sunday evening.</p> <p>Unlike other meetings, we *do not* have any reading material. Come with an open mind.</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>The Recurring Rainfall Problem</p> <p>Soloway's Rainfall problem, a classic benchmark in computing education research, has proven difficult for many CS1 students.  Rainfall tests students' abilities at plan composition, the task of integrating code fragments that implement subparts of a problem into a single program. Nearly all prior studies of Rainfall have involved students who were learning imperative programming with arrays.  In our recent multi-university study, students learning functional programming produced atypical profiles of compositions and errors on Rainfall. What do these different results suggest about the problem of plan composition and programming education?</p> <p>This talk raises various questions about the relationships between programming languages, program design, curricula, and how students perceive code structure.  I'll describe results from both our earlier Rainfall study and some work-in-progress that attempts to further tease apart these relationships.  The talk assumes no experience with either functional programming or having been rained upon.</p> <p>Joint work primarily with Kathi Fisler.</p> <p>A bit of rambling from a meetup organizer. Please tolerate.</p> <p>The only expectation from attendees is to click the right RSVP button once. That's all. How hard is it to be not a jerk? This time, for Shriram's convenience we booked a 3/4 ★ hotel conference room near his accommodation. It is costing someone real money to give you a good space. It is very difficult to plan anything when attendees act without any consideration for the people who try to do good for them. If you are not coming, please RSVP no.</p> <p>Its alright when a large office is hosting it. InMobi had a lot of space and even if the number goes up or down, we don't care. We will be able to manage. Not when we book a hotel for a fixed number of people. Please don't make me say this after every meetup</p> <p>1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriram_Krishnamurthi"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriram_Krishnamurthi" class="linkified">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriram_Krishnamurthi</a></a></p> <p>2. <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/"><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/" class="linkified">http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/</a></a></p>

      <b>Abstract: </b></p> <p>Static and dynamic type systems have well-known strengths and weaknesses, and each is better suited for different programming tasks. There have been many efforts to integrate static and dynamic typing and thereby combine the benefits of both typing disciplines in the same language. The flexibility of static typing can be improved by adding a type Dynamic and a typecase form. The safety and performance of dynamic typing can be improved by adding optional type annotations or by performing type inference (as in soft typing). However, there has been little formal work on type systems that allow a programmer-controlled migration between dynamic and static typing. </p> <p>


       In this paper we present a solution based on the intuition that the structure of a type may be partially known/unknown at compile-time and the job of the type system is to catch incompatibilities between the known parts of types. We define the static and dynamic semantics of a λ calculus with optional type annotations and we prove that its type system is sound with respect to the simply-typed λ calculus for fully-annotated terms. We prove that this calculus is type safe and that the cost of dynamism is pay-as-you-go.</p>

    description: '<p><b>Abstract</b>: <i> Eventual consistency aims to ensure that
      replicas of some mutable shared object converge without foreground synchronisation.
      Previous approaches to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study
      a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple
      formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We
      call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).</i></p>
      <p><b>Reference Paper</b>:  <a href="http://hal.upmc.fr/inria-00555588/document">A
      comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a></p>
      <p><b>Overview</b>: Replication is a fundamental concept of distributed systems.
      Any data update must be replicated to all peers in the system, if the system
      were to behave like a single system. This is usually achieved  by introducing
      coordination, but it is expensive and can become infeasible quickly. An alternative
      approach is to build systems that are eventually consistent by removing coordination
      from the hot path, but there can be conflicts and conflict resolution is generally
      complex. </p> <p>CRDT''s are any data structures (and associated operations)
      that have some simple mathematical properties. These properties are immensely
      useful in building distributed systems that are eventually consistent and conflict
      free by design. There are may known CRDT''s and the paper listed above catalogs
      them. While CRDT''s are not general purpose, a lot of real life problems can
      be solved by using CRDT''s. </p> <p><br/>In this talk, I hope to cover everything
      needed from the ground up, including the rudimentary mathematics needed to understand
      CRDT''s, walk through some of the data structures and prove that they are CRDT''s,
      discuss problems that can be solved with CRDT''s, their practical limitations,
      along with a general discussion/rant on distributed systems, consensus and consistency
      models. </p> <p>- Vipin</p>'

    description: <p>We are delighted to announce the first paper and meetup for our Papers We Love chapter. The event will take place at the end of the summer mainly because of planned holidays, the time needed to allow more people to find out about our new community and final organizational details. Techsociety, our new great partner, has made it possible for us to host the event at Techhub.   </p> <p>The chosen paper, "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine", was written at Stanford by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page to introduce Google and a nowadays established algorithm in Information Retrieval, PageRank. You can access it here, <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/334.pdf" class="linkified">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/334.pdf</a> . We hope that you will enjoy reading it over the summer and come and join our discussion and presentation. </p>

    description: <p>Stackless Scala with Free Monads is a fairly easy to read paper with many practical applications. It introduces trampolines as a means to avoid stackoverflow errors on programming languages of the JVM and generalizes them into the Free Monad, a structure which can help writing monadic expressions for any type constructor if a functor is defined. Free monads can be useful in tackling the expression problem which is part of another paper.</p> <p>The paper can be found here:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf"><a href="http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf" class="linkified">http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>and you are expected to have at least tried to read it when coming to the meetup so that we can efficiently discuss it.</p>

    description: <p><b>The Essence of the Iterator pattern </b>treats iterating over collections as two problems, which exhibit traversal of collections (and modifying the content) and accumulating values based on the contents.  Jeremy Gibbons and Bruno C.d.S.

    description: '<p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Immutable vectors are a convenient data
      structure for functional programming and part of the standard library of modern
      languages like Clojure and Scala. The common implementation is based on wide
      trees with a fixed number of children per node, which allows fast indexed lookup
      and update operations. In this paper, the authors extend the vector data type
      with a new underlying data structure, Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees (RRB-Trees),
      and show how this structure allows immutable vector concatenation, insert-at
      and splits in O(logN) time while maintaining the index, update and iteration
      speeds of the original vector data structure.</p> <p><br/>Chris Bilson will

      <b>Abstract</b></p> <p>





      Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.</p> <p>





      Arunabha Ghosh, director of Engineering at Moz, will be presenting this paper. Before Moz, Arunabha spend around 7 years at Google working on large scale distributed systems. I hope to see all of you for an insightful discussion.</p> <p>

    description: '<p><i>We will be covering the paper that launched many other NoSQL
      databases over the years. Apache Cassandra, Voldemort, Riak to name a few.</i></p>
      <p><b>ABSTRACT </b>Reliability at massive scale is one of the biggest challenges
      we face at Amazon.com, one of the largest e-commerce operations in the world;
      even the slightest outage has significant financial consequences and impacts
      customer trust. The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web
      sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands
      of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world.
      At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent
      state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability
      of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of
      Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon’s core
      services use to provide an “always-on” experience. To achieve this level of
      availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios.
      It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict
      resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.

After two decades of fundamental research in to the nature of computation, a lot of mysterious ideas in computer science such as continuations and exception handling finally made sense to a number of mathematically inclined geniuses. Bauer and Pretnar's Eff programming language cuts right through the heart of the theory in a way that makes sense to anybody who has ever written a functional program. This paper uses the Eff language to explore a number of simple computational effects that were traditionally viewed as quite varied and complex.</p> <p><b>Brandon's Bio</b></p> <p>Brandon Bloom walks a fine line between laser focused pragmatism and broad academic interests. Most recently in his varied career, Brandon worked on Code.org's Hour Of Code campaign. In the past, he's founded and sold a startup, as well as worked on Microsoft Xbox and Google Translate. Now, he's indulging his inner scientist and exploring technology for his next venture.

      <p>Chain replication is a new approach to coordinating clusters of fail-stop
      storage servers. The approach is intended for supporting large-scale storage
      services that exhibit high throughput and availability without sacrificing strong
      consistency guarantees. Besides outlining the chain replication protocols themselves,
      simulation experiments explore the performance characteristics of a prototype
      implementation. Throughput, availability, and several objectplacement strategies
      (including schemes based on distributed hash table routing) are discussed.</p>

    description: '<p>Derek Elkins will present on "Dedalus: Datalog in Time and Space"
      touching also on some follow-on work.</p> <p><b>Abstract. </b></p> <p>Recent
      research has explored using Datalog-based languages to express a distributed
      system as a set of logical invariants. Two properties of distributed systems
      proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves
      with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed,
      dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous
      efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints,
      persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery
      while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which
      increases the complexity of the language and its interpretation, and forces
      programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from
      these previous languages is a notion of time.</p> <p>In this paper we present
      Dedalus, a foundation language for programming and reasoning about distributed
      systems. Dedalus reduces to a subset of Datalog with negation, aggregate functions,
      successor and choice, and adds an explicit notion of logical time to the language.
      We show that Dedalus provides a declarative foundation for the two signature
      features of distributed systems: mutable state, and asynchronous processing
      and communication. Given these two features, we address two important properties
      of programs in a domain-specific manner: a notion of safety appropriate to non-terminating
      computations, and stratified monotonic reasoning with negation over time. We
      also provide conservative syntactic checks for our temporal notions of safety
      and stratification. Our experience implementing full-featured systems in variants
      of Datalog suggests that Dedalus is well-suited to the specification of rich
      distributed services and protocols, and provides both cleaner semantics and
      richer tests of correctness.</p> <p>Tech Report version: <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-173.html"><a

    description: <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We present Mesos, a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiple diverse cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI. Sharing improves cluster utilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data stored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks, Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers. Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our results show that Mesos can achieve near-optimal data locality when sharing the cluster among diverse frameworks, can scale to 50,000 (emulated) nodes, and is resilient to failures.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Presenter:</b></p> <p>Ankur Chauhan</p> <p><b>Links:</b></p> <p><a href="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf"><a href="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/><a href="http://mesos.apache.org"><a href="http://mesos.apache.org" class="linkified">http://mesos.apache.org</a></a></p> <p><br/><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/mesos-frameworks/">List of Mesos Frameworks</a></p>

    description: <p>David Murray will present <a href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf">Ideal Hash Trees</a>:</p> <p>"Hash Trees with nearly ideal characteristics are described. These Hash Trees require no initial root hash table yet are faster and use significantly less space than chained or double hash trees. Insert, search and delete times are small and constant, independent of key set size, operations are O(1). Small worst-case times for insert, search and removal operations can be guaranteed and misses cost less than successful searches. Array Mapped Tries(AMT), first described in Fast and Space Efficient Trie Searches, Bagwell [2000], form the underlying data structure. The concept is then applied to external disk or distributed storage to obtain an algorithm that achieves single access searches, close to single access inserts and greater than 80 percent disk block load factors. Comparisons are made with Linear Hashing, Litwin, Neimat, and Schneider [1993] and B-Trees, R.Bayer and E.M.McCreight [1972]. In addition two further applications of AMTs are briefly described, namely, Class/Selector dispatch tables and IP Routing tables. Each of the algorithms has a performance and space usage that is comparable to contemporary implementations but simpler. "</p>

      <b>Abstract: </b></p> <p>We present the research, and product development and deployment, of Voice Analyzer™ by Jobaline Inc. This is a patent pending technology that analyzes voice data and predicts human emotions elicited by the paralinguistic elements of a voice.</p> <p>Human voice characteristics, such as tone, complement the verbal communication. In several contexts of communication, “how” things are said is just as important as “what” is being said. This paper provides an overview of our deployed system, the raw data, the data processing steps, and the prediction algorithms we experimented with. A case study is included where, given a voice clip, our model predicts the degree in which a listener will find the voice “engaging”. Our prediction results were verified through independent market research with 75% in agreement on how an average listener would feel. One application of Jobaline Voice Analyzer technology is for assisting companies to hire workers in the service industry where customers’ emotional response to workers’ voice may affect the service outcome. Jobaline Voice Analyzer is deployed in production as a product offer to our clients to help them identify workers who will better engage with their customers. We will also share some discoveries and lessons learned.</p> <p>Link to the paper: </p> <p><a href="https://goo.gl/uJ4Mvk"><a href="https://goo.gl/uJ4Mvk" class="linkified">https://goo.gl/uJ4Mvk</a></a></p>

    description: <p>Trevor Lalish-Menagh will present "A Critique of the CAP Theorem." Abstract:</p> <p>The CAP Theorem is a frequently cited impossibility result in distributed systems, especially among NoSQL distributed databases. In this paper we survey some of the confusion about the meaning of CAP, including inconsistencies and ambiguities in its definitions, and we highlight some problems in its formalization. CAP is often interpreted as proof that eventually consistent databases have better availability properties than strongly consistent databases; although there is some truth in this, we show that more careful reasoning is required. These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems. As alternative to CAP, we propose a "delay-sensitivity" framework, which analyzes the sensitivity of operation latency to network delay, and which may help practitioners reason about the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and tolerance of network faults.</p> <p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05393" class="linkified">http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05393</a></p>

    description: '<p>Ankur Chauhan will present the latest research on stream processing
      systems that was recently presented at VLDB 2015 by the team at Google. The
      paper is titled: "<b>The Dataflow Model: A Practical Approach to Balancing Correctness,
      Latency, and Cost in Massive-Scale, Unbounded, Out-of-Order Data Processing</b>".
      This presents the state of the art in stream processing systems at scale and
      are also the technologies that lie at the heart of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/what-is-google-cloud-dataflow">Google
      Cloud Dataflow</a>.</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Unbounded, unordered, global-scale
      datasets are increasingly common in day-to-day business (e.g. Web logs, mobile
      usage statistics, and sensor networks). At the same time, consumers of these
      datasets have evolved sophisticated requirements, such as event-time ordering
      and windowing by features of the data themselves, in addition to an insatiable
      hunger for faster answers. Meanwhile, practicality dictates that one can never
      fully optimize along all dimensions of correctness, latency, and cost for these
      types of input. As a result, data processing practitioners are left with the
      quandary of how to reconcile the tensions between these seemingly competing
      propositions, often resulting in disparate implementations and systems. We propose
      that a fundamental shift of approach is necessary to deal with these evolved
      requirements in modern data processing. We as a field must stop trying to groom
      unbounded datasets into finite pools of information that eventually become complete,
      and instead live and breathe under the assumption that we will never know if
      or when we have seen all of our data, only that new data will arrive, old data
      may be retracted, and the only way to make this problem tractable is via principled
      abstractions that allow the practitioner the choice of appropriate tradeoffs
      along the axes of interest: correctness, latency, and cost. In this paper, we
      present one such approach, the Dataflow Model, along with a detailed examination
      of the semantics it enables, an overview of the core principles that guided
      its design, and a validation of the model itself via the real-world experiences
      that led to its development.</p> <p><br/><b>Papers:</b></p> <p>* <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf">The

      backlog of topics, I''ve heard from a couple interested people who have trouble
      making the usual Thursday timeslot, so I figured it might be fun to try a second
      event in January on a different night of the week to spread the love around.
      For the moment I''m only committing to one, but if it''s a hit maybe we''ll
      turn it into a regular thing. Let me know your feelings on the subject, if you

      with RAMP Transactions" by Peter Bailis, Alan Fekete, Ali Ghodsi, Joseph M.
      Hellerstein and Ion Stoica.</p> <p>It''s a fresh paper of last year (2014) where
      authors propose a new isolation model — Read Atomic (RA) isolation — that helps
      to achieve incredible scalability in multi-partition distributed databases.</p>
      <p>Read Atomic isolation is similar to Read Committed isolation, and provides
      atomic visibility: either all or none of each transaction’s updates are observed
      by other transactions. Bailis and friends describe algorithms for Read Atomic
      MultiPartition (RAMP) transactions that enforce atomic visibility while offering
      excellent scalability, guaranteed commit despite partial failures (via synchronization
      independence), and minimized communication between servers (via partition independence).</p>
      <p>We''ll discuss RAMP transactions, its limitations and the way to handle the
      lost update problem.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/ramp-sigmod2014.pdf"><a

    description: '<p>Tristan Penman will present Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup
      Service for Internet Applications.</p> <p>"A fundamental problem that confronts
      peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular
      data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses
      this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it
      maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of
      Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item
      pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join
      and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously
      changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex- periments
      show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained
      by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes."</p> <p><a

      consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some mutable shared object converge

      of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to

      Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This paper formalises asynchronous object replication,
      either state based or operation based, and provides a sufficient condition appropriate

    description: |-
      <p>Many prior efforts have suggested that Internet video Quality of Experience (QoE) could be dramatically improved by using data-driven prediction of video quality for different choices (e.g., CDN or bitrate) to make optimal decisions. However, building such a prediction system is challenging on two fronts. First, the relationships between video quality and observed session features can be quite complex. Second, video quality changes dynamically. Thus, we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capture these complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions (e.g., simple machine learning approaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus, the potential benefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized. We address these challenges and present the design and implementation of Critical Feature Analytics (CFA). The design of CFA is driven by domain-specific insights that video quality is typically determined by a small subset of critical features whose criticality persists over several tens of minutes. This enables a scalable and accurate workflow where we automatically learn critical features for different sessions on coarse-grained timescales, while updating quality predictions in near real-time. Using a combination of a real-world pilot deployment and trace-driven analysis, we demonstrate that CFA leads to significant improvements in video quality; e.g., 32% less buffering time and 12% higher bitrate than a random decision maker.</p> <p>Paper: <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf"><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-jiang-junchen.pdf</a></a></p> <p>

      Distributed Data Structures over a Shared Log</a>.</p> <p>```<br/>Distributed
      systems are easier to build than ever with the emergence of new, data-centric
      abstractions for storing and computing over massive datasets. However, similar
      abstractions do not exist for storing and accessing metadata. To fill this gap,
      Tango provides developers with the abstraction of a replicated, in-memory data
      structure (such as a map or a tree) backed by a shared log. Tango objects are
      easy to build and use, replicating state via simple append and read operations
      on the shared log instead of complex distributed protocols; in the process,
      they obtain properties such as linearizability, persistence and high availability
      from the shared log. Tango also leverages the shared log to enable fast transactions
      across different objects, allowing applications to partition state across machines
      and scale to the limits of the underlying log without sacrificing consistency.<br/>```</p>

New Directions in Cryptography introduced the idea of digital signatures and public key cryptosystems, and reduced both problems to the search for a trap-door one-way permutation. Although Diffie and Hellman were unable to come up with such a permutation (settling for "just" Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange), they laid the theoretical framework and invited others to join the search. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman read the paper, did a lot of hard thinking, and a year later published A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems - now known as the RSA algorithm.</p> <p>David works on Infrastructure Security for Salesforce.com.</p> <p><b>Who What Where</b><br/>Big ups to <a href="https://www.wework.com/">WeWork</a> for providing the space and <a href="https://trust.salesforce.com/en/security/">Salesforce</a> for providing the victuals!

    description: '<p>To parse or not to parse: a two-for-one paper-loving showdown!</p>
      <p><br/><b>David Murray presents <a href="http://www.voelter.de/data/pub/projectingModuleFuture.pdf">Projecting
      a Modular Future</a></b></p> <p>"We describe two innovations in programming
      languages: modularity and projectional editing. Language modularity refers to
      the ability to combine independently developed languages without changing their
      respective definitions. A language is not anymore a fixed quantity, instead
      it can be extended with domain-specific constructs as needed. Projectional editing
      refers to a technique of building editors and IDEs that avoid the need for parsers.
      They support a wide range of tightly integrated notations including textual,
      symbolic, tabular and graphical. In addition, by avoiding parsers, the well-known
      limitations of grammar composition are avoided as well."</p> <p><b>David Graunke
      presents <a href="http://matt.might.net/papers/might2011derivatives.pdf">Parsing
      with Derivatives</a></b></p> <p>"We present a functional approach to parsing
      unrestricted context-free grammars based on Brzozowski’s derivative of regular
      expressions. If we consider context-free grammars as recursive regular expressions,
      Brzozowski’s equational theory extends without modification to context-free
      grammars (and it generalizes to parser combinators). The supporting actors in
      this story are three concepts familiar to functional programmers—laziness, memoization
      and fixed points; these allow Brzozowski’s original equations to be transliterated
      into purely functional code in about 30 lines spread over three functions."<b><br/></b></p>

      <p>Welcome to the first DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p><br/>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers. There's so much we can learn from the landmark research that shaped the field and the current studies that are shaping our future. Our goal is to create a community of tech professionals passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. Come join us!</p> <p><br/>New to research papers? Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eRx5Wo3xYA">The Refreshingly Rewarding Realm of Research Papers</a> by Sean Cribbs.</p> <p><br/>Ideas and suggestions are welcome–fill our our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJwLQhnmzWcuyodPrSmqHgqrvNxRbnNSbiWAuwzHwshhy_Sg/viewform">interest survey here</a> and let us know what motivates you!</p> <p>



      <b>// Tentative Schedule<br/></b></p> <p>• 7:00-7:30–Food and informal paper discussion</p> <p>• 7:30-7:35–Introduction and announcements</p> <p>• 7:35-8:05–<i><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf">Programming as Theory Building</a></i> (presentation + discussion) by Chris Hoffman</p> <p><br/>• 8:05-8:10–Break</p> <p>• 8:10-8:40–<i><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903">A Categorical Theory of Patches </a></i>by Hunter Madison</p> <p><br/>• 8:40-9:00–Food and informal paper discussion</p> <p>



      <b>// Directions</b></p> <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nTDraCkS7uw"> CustomInk Cafe (3rd Floor)<br/>Mosaic District, 2910 District Ave #300<br/>Fairfax, VA 22031</a></p> <p>When you get here you can come in via the patio. Don't be scared by the metal gate and sign. It's accessible via the outside stairs near True Food. There is a parking garage next door for those coming by vehicle. And, there is a walkway to the patio on the 3rd floor of the garage nearest moms organic market.</p> <p><br/><b>Metro:</b> The Dunn Loring metro station is about 0.7 miles from our meetup location. It’s very walkable, but if you’d prefer a bus, the 402 Southbound and 1A/1B/1C Westbound leave from Dunn Loring Station about every 5-10 minutes (see a schedule for more detailed timetable).</p> <p><br/>If you're late, we totally understand–please still come! (via the patio is best) Just be sure to slip in quietly if a speaker is presenting.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>// Papers</b></p> <p>• <i>Programming as Theory Building</i> by Peter Naur<br/>Presented by Chris Hoffman, Senior Software Engineer at Optoro<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf"></p> <p>pdf</a> | <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw/WwXKAGnW">text (mobile-friendly)</a></p> <p><b>Chris's Remarks: </b>This paper describes agile a decade-and-a-half before the Manifesto on Agile Software Development. It's got everything in there: People over Process, No Single Process, even a preference for knowledge in developer's heads over "knowledge" represented in documentation &amp; manuals.</p> <p>I'll be recapping the paper briefly and discuss what a "Theory of a Program" is. I'll then move onto talking about the parallels between Naur's Theories and Kuhn's (whom Naur invokes in the paper) notion of Paradigm in traditional science. I'll end by discussing how this paper influenced the Agile movement (Alistair Cockburn in particular) and why it's still massively relevant today.<b></p> <p>About Peter Naur: </b>Peter Naur was a Danish computer science pioneer and Turing award winner. His last name is the "N" in the BNF notation (Backus-Naur form), used in the description of the syntax for most programming languages. He contributed to the creation of the ALGOL 60 programming language (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur">from Wikipedia</a>).</p> <p>

      • <i>A Categorical Theory of Patches</i> by <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/">Samuel Mimram</a> and <a href="http://www.i3s.unice.fr/digiusto/">Cinzia Di Giusto</a><br/>Presented by Hunter Madison, CustomInk</p> <p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903">homepage</a> | <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.3903v1">pdf</a></p> <p><b>Summary: </b>For most of us, version control is an integral part of our professional workflow. It's difficult to imagine working on large teams or long-term projects without the ability to branch or merge! But how does it actually work?</p> <p>This paper takes a look "under the hood" of version control–its aim is to provide a formal mathematical definition of patches using category theory. It starts with the basic case of two users who make non-conflicting changes on the same file, goes over increasingly complex examples, and finally explores the general case.</p> <p><br/><b>Note:</b> In contrast to the first paper, this paper is heavy on mathematical terminology and notation. The introduction provides a good summary, and I suggest keeping your browser open to look up unfamiliar terms. I like <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">Category Theory for Programmers</a> (a set of blog posts by Bartosz Milewski) as an introduction.</p>

      <p>Get excited about the new year by discussing some Papers We Love!</p> <p>This month, our meeting will be a little different. Instead of a structured presentation, we'll enjoy some pizza, cookies, and conversation. If you have a side project that you want to share, bring your laptop! If you've read a great paper recently, we'd love to hear about it! Otherwise, just show up ready to talk with others who love to learn.</p> <p>


      <b>// Tentative Schedule<br/></b></p> <p>• 7:00-7:30–Food and conversation</p> <p>• 7:30-7:35–Introduction and announcements</p> <p>• 7:00-7:30–More food and conversation</p> <p>

Don't be scared by the metal gate and sign. It's accessible via the outside stairs near True Food. There is a parking garage next door for those coming by vehicle. And, there is a walkway to the patio on the 3rd floor of the garage nearest moms organic market.</p> <p>Metro: The Dunn Loring metro station is about 0.7 miles from our meetup location. It’s very walkable, but if you’d prefer a bus, the 402 Southbound and 1A/1B/1C Westbound leave from Dunn Loring Station about every 5-10 minutes (see a schedule for more detailed timetable).</p> <p>If you're late, we totally understand–please still come! (via the patio is best) Just be sure to slip in quietly if a speaker is presenting. </p> <p><br/><b>// About Papers We Love</b></p> <p><br/>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

      <b>// Papers</b><i><br/></i></p> <p>• <i>Parallel computation with molecular-motor-propelled agents in nanofabricated networks</i> by <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/bioengineering/people/faculty/dan-nicolau">Dan V. Nicolau, Jr.</a>, et al<br/>Presented by Sam DeLuca</p> <p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/10/2591">homepage</a> | <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/10/2591.full.pdf">pdf</a></p> <p><b>Research Significance: </b>Electronic computers are extremely powerful at performing a high number of operations at very high speeds, sequentially. However, they struggle with combinatorial tasks that can be solved faster if many operations are performed in parallel. Here, we present proof-of-concept of a parallel computer by solving the specific instance {2, 5, 9} of a classical nondeterministic-polynomial-time complete (“NP-complete”) problem, the subset sum problem. The computer consists of a specifically designed, nanostructured network explored by a large number of molecular-motor-driven, protein filaments. This system is highly energy efficient, thus avoiding the heating issues limiting electronic computers. We discuss the technical advances necessary to solve larger combinatorial problems than existing computation devices, potentially leading to a new way to tackle difficult mathematical problems.</p> <p><b>About Sam: </b>Sam DeLuca is a software engineer at <a href="https://www.cloudlock.com/">CloudLock</a>, a cloud security company based in Massachusetts, where he works on task scheduling and messaging infrastructure. His background is in bioinformatics, including work on <a href="https://www.rosettacommons.org/">Rosetta</a>, a molecular modeling system.</p>

      </b>The analysis of multilayer networks is among the most active areas of network
      science, and there are now several methods to detect dense "communities" of
      nodes in multilayer networks. One way to define a community is as a set of nodes
      that trap a diffusion-like dynamical process (usually a random walk) for a long
      time. In this view, communities are sets of nodes that create bottlenecks to
      the spreading of a dynamical process on a network. We analyze the local behavior
      of different random walks on multiplex networks (which are multilayer networks
      in which different layers correspond to different types of edges) and show that
      they have very different bottlenecks that hence correspond to rather different
      notions of what it means for a set of nodes to be a good community. This has
      direct implications for the behavior of community-detection methods that are
      based on these random walks.</p> <p><b>About Mandi:</b> Mandi is a Senior Data

      <p>From the site, "Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy
      to understand. It''s equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance.
      The difference is that it''s decomposed into relatively independent subproblems,
      and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope
      Raft will make consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider
      audience will be able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based
      systems than are available today."</p>'

    <p><b>// What is Papers We Love?</b> <br></p>
    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</p>

    description: '<p>For our first meetup Ólafur R. Helgason will present and lead
      the discussion on <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf">Chord:
      A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications</a>.</p> <p>We
      hope to see as many as possible and I hope we can make these meetups a regular
      thing.</p> <p><b>Abstract<br/></b>A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer
      applications is the efficient location of the node that stores a desired data
      item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses
      this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it
      maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of
      Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data pair
      at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and
      leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously
      changing. Results from theoretical analysis and simulations show that Chord
      is scalable: communication cost and the state maintained by each node scale
      logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes. </p> <p><b>Bio</b><br/>Ólafur
      is currently the VP of Engineering at OZ. He received his PhD in Computer Science
      from KTH. At KTH he was a post-doc researcher at the Laboratory for Communication
      Networks researching opportunistic networking and mobile wireless systems. Before
      going to KTH he was a researcher and teacher at Reykjavík University focusing
      mainly on Computer Networks.</p> <p><b>Details<br/></b>Doors open at 18:00;
      the presentation will begin at 18:20; and, yes, there will be beer, water, and
      pizza. </p> <p>After Ólafur presents the paper, we will open up the floor to
      discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you''ll read the paper before
      the meetup, but don''t stress if you can''t.  If you have any questions, thoughts,
      or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/211">github-thread</a>*

    description: '<p>This time it will be very informal, we will meet up at the coffee
      house <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stofan.cafe">Stofan Café</a> as they
      have comfortable couches, beers and good coffee.</p> <p>Instead of having a
      speaker giving a talk on the paper we will simply try to explain it to each
      other and have some fun discussions that almost always go way off topic :)<br/>Reading
      the paper is highly recommended but don''t stress it.</p> <p><br/>--<br/>The
      paper we will discuss is "TAO: Facebook''s Distributed Data Store for the Social
      Graph".</p> <p>"A single Facebook page may aggregate and filter hundreds of
      items from the social graph. We present each user with content tailored to them,
      and we filter every item with privacy checks that take into account the current
      viewer. This extreme customization makes it infeasible to perform most aggregation
      and filtering when content is created; instead we resolve data dependencies
      and check privacy each time the content is viewed. As much as possible we pull
      the social graph, rather than pushing it. This implementation strategy places
      extreme read demands on the graph data store; it must be efficient, highly available,
      and scale to high query rates."<br/>- Nathan Bronson</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p><br/>We
      introduce a simple data model and API tailored for serving the social graph,
      and TAO, an implementation of this model. TAO is a geographically distributed
      data store that provides efficient and timely access to the so- cial graph for
      Facebook’s demanding workload using a fixed set of queries. It is deployed at
      Facebook, replac- ing memcache for many data types that fit its model. The system
      runs on thousands of machines, is widely dis- tributed, and provides access
      to many petabytes of data. TAO can process a billion reads and millions of writes
      each second. </p> <p><br/>Paper link: <a href="https://facebook.com/download/273893712748848/atc13-bronson.pdf"><a

      Since we've already covered <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Vienna/events/218624428/">Google's Bigtable</a>, we're taking an in-depth look at the second forerunner of the NoSQL movement: Dynamo, which is pretty <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/de/dynamodb/">popular in practise</a> as well.</p> <p>

      Again, please read the <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">paper</a> in advance so we can have a lively discussion — led by <a href="https://twitter.com/xeraa">me</a> this time :)</p> <p>

      And please propose the next paper you want to dissect. Ideally, it's something more theoretical since we agreed to alternate between theoretical and practical papers.</p> <p>

      Hi all,</p> <p>this time Martin will introduce us to the world of data science with the paper <a href="http://oz.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf">RANDOM FORESTS</a>. As always, please read the paper in advance, so we can have a fruitful discussion. And don't be discouraged by the number of pages, it seems to be typed pretty loosely — let's see how the mathematical formulas come along ;-)</p> <p>See you in June,<br/>Philipp</p>

Our interface is powered by the Introspective Adversarial Network, a hybridization of the Generative Adversarial Network and the Variational Autoencoder designed for use in the editor. Our model makes use of a novel computational block based on dilated convolutions, and Orthogonal Regularization, a novel weight regularization method. We validate our model on CelebA, SVHN, and ImageNet, and produce samples and reconstructions with high visual fidelity.</i></p> <p><br/><i><br/></i></p> <p>See you next week,<br/>Philipp</p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b>:</p> <p>Log processing has become a critical component of
      the data pipeline for consumer internet companies. We introduce Kafka, a distributed
      messaging system that we developed for collecting and delivering high volumes
      of log data with low latency. Our system incorporates ideas from existing log
      aggregators and messaging systems, and is suitable for both offline and online
      message consumption. We made quite a few unconventional yet practical design
      choices in Kafka to make our system efficient and scalable. Our experimental
      results show that Kafka has superior performance when compared to two popular
      messaging systems. We have been using Kafka in production for some time and
      it is processing hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day.</p> <p><b>Local</b>:</p>

It supports high-availability applications with runtime features that minimize fault-recovery time, and scheduling policies that reduce the probability of correlated failures.

"<a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/886.pdf">What do programmers know about software energy consumption?</a>", in IEEE Software, vol. 33, no. 3, pp. 83-89, May-June 2016.</p> <p><br/><b>PDF</b>:</p> <p><a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/886.pdf"><a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/886.pdf" class="linkified">https://peerj.com/preprints/886.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b>Abstract</b>:</p> <p>Traditionally, programmers have received a wide range of training on programming languages and methodologies, but rarely about software energy consumption. Yet, the popularity of mobile devices and cloud computing require increased awareness about software energy consumption. On a mobile device, computation is often limited by the battery life. Under the demands of cloud computing, data centers struggle to reduce energy consumption through virtualization and data center infrastructure management (DCIM) systems. Efficient energy consumption of software is increasingly becoming an important non-functional requirement for programmers. However, are programmers knowledgeable enough about software energy consumption? Do programmers base their implementation decision on popular beliefs? In this article, we survey over 100 programmers for their knowledge of software energy consumption. We find that programmers have limited knowledge about energy efficiency, lack the knowledge about the best practice to reduce energy consumption of software, and are often unsure about how software consumes energy. Education about the importance of energy effective software will benefit the programmers. Our results highlight the need for training about energy consumption and efficiency.</p> <p>Hangout:</p> <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cam7v6phqcdls7332m214bioueo"><a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cam7v6phqcdls7332m214bioueo" class="linkified">https://plus.google.com/events/cam7v6phqcdls7332m214bioueo</a></a></p>

      <p>Marco Rietveld presents Michael &amp; Scott's paper on their CAS/non-blocking queue algorithm: <a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf"><a href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b>About the Paper</b></p> <p>

      Michael and Scott are among the better known names in the area of synchronization and locking in computer science. This paper from 1996 is one of the first papers that explains a non-blocking algorithm. While the algorithms described in the paper have been improved upon since then, the paper is a good starting point for those interested in non-blocking algorithms and also showcases a number of concepts used in concurrency.</p> <p><b>About the Speaker</b></p> <p>

      Marco is a Java Software Engineer at JBoss (by Red Hat) where he works on the jBPM and Drools projects. He stays as far as possible away from anything having to do with the front-end and loves concurrency. He lives in Utrecht.</p> <p>

      This talk is targeted at those who have at least a basic knowledge of one programming language, preferably C, C++ Java or a language that contains the concept of "threads". While some knowledge of concurrency ideas such as locks, or CAS (compare and swap) is helpful, I'll be introducing those ideas during the talk.</p>

    <p><span>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment.</span></p>

    description: <p>Abstract:</p> <p>a ∧ ¬(b ∨ a). Is there some assignment to a and b that makes the expression true? This is the well known problem of Boolean satisfiability (SAT). This problem can be extended to predicates over non-Boolean values. For example, is the following satisfiable? (c &lt; d) ∧ (d ≤ c + 1). This extended problem is known as Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). In this talk, I will present an <a href="http://cis.upenn.edu/~alur/CIS673/smt11.pdf">introduction to SMT</a> and its many applications, from scheduling to static program analysis to dependency resolution. I will end with concrete examples, demonstrating how to use an SMT solver from Haskell to prove assertions about a program.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/beala">Alex</a> is software developer interested in using modern techniques to write more reliable programs, and is particularly optimistic about the intersection of industry and academia. Other times, he'd rather be outside. He's currently a software engineer at Twitter.</p>

    description: <p>For the very first Papers We Love Berlin Meetup, we will have Erik Michaels-Ober from SoundCloud presenting the paper Soft Typing by Robert Cartwright and Mike Fagan.</p> <p>This is particularly interesting for Rubyists, because Ruby 3.0 might ship with such a type system.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>This paper presents a soft type systems that retains the expressiveness of dynamic typing, but offers the early error detection and improved optimization capabilities of static typing. The key idea underlying soft typing is that a type checker need not reject programs containing "ill-typed" phrases. Instead, the type checker can insert explicit run-time checks, transforming "ill-typed" programs into type-correct ones.</p> <p>PDF: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" class="linkified">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.9333&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></a></p> <p>Thanks to ResearchGate for hosting this first edition!</p>

    description: <p>At this Papers We Love Berlin Meetup we will have Marijn Haverbeke (<a href="https://twitter.com/marijnjh" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/marijnjh</a>) presenting the original Lisp paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine" by John McCarthy.</p> <p>PDF: <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf"><a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf" class="linkified">http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf</a></a> </p> <p>Thanks to Soundcloud for hosting this event! </p> <p><br/>Abstract:</p> <p>There are works that, rather than continuing in an existing research tradition, invent a whole new direction. John McCarthy's original paper on Lisp is definitely one such work. It obviously set the stage for the various Lisps and Lisp-inspired languages, but it also pioneered a number of concepts, ranging from garbage collection to the call stack, that are deeply ingrained in today's programming reality. This talk will be mostly about historical perspective (and will not involve Lisp smugness or propaganda).</p> <p><br/>Bio:</p> <p>Marijn Haverbeke spent his early career living in the past and programming Common Lisp. When reality finally caught up with him he gave that up and became a JavaScript programmer instead. Author of CodeMirror and Eloquent JavaScript. Contributor to the Rust compiler.</p>

    description: <p>For our second meetup, we're excited to have <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonBloom">Brandon Bloom</a> presenting the paper <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/plt/programming-with-algebraic-effects-and-handlers.pdf?raw=true">Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers</a> by Andrej Bauer and Matija Pretnar.</p> <p><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Some great papers embody insights, others package up those insights into digestible bites. "Programing with Algebraic Effects and Handlers" is the later sort of great paper. After two decades of fundamental research in to the nature of computation, a lot of mysterious ideas in computer science such as continuations and exception handling finally made sense to a number of mathematically inclined geniuses. Bauer and Pretnar's Eff programming language cuts right through the heart of the theory in a way that makes sense to anybody who has ever written a functional program. This paper uses the Eff language to explore a number of simple computational effects that were traditionally viewed as quite varied and complex.</p> <p><b>Brandon's Bio</b></p> <p>Brandon Bloom walks a fine line between laser focused pragmatism and broad academic interests. Most recently in his varied career, Brandon worked on Code.org's Hour Of Code campaign. In the past, he's founded and sold a startup, as well as worked on Microsoft Xbox and Google Translate. Now, he's indulging his inner scientist and exploring technology for his next venture.

      <p>We're thrilled to have <a href="https://github.com/dgrnbrg">David Greenberg</a> presenting <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/matei/papers/2013/sosp_sparrow.pdf">Sparrow: Distributed, Low Latency Scheduling</a> by Kay Ousterhout, Patrick Wendell, Matei Zaharia and Ion Stoica. </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>When you need to execute code on a cluster of machines, deciding which machine should run that code becomes a complex problem, known as scheduling. We're all familiar with routing problems, such as the recent <a href="http://news.rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-annotated">RapGenius incident</a>. It turns out that simple improvements to randomized routing can dramatically improve the performance! Sparrow is a distributed scheduling algorithm for low latency, high throughput workloads. We'll review the Sparrow algorithm, and learn the tricks that they used. Then, we'll discuss other applications of Sparrow, besides the big-data map-reduce application it was created for. </p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>David Greenberg loves learning. He currently works at Two Sigma, where he leads several efforts to build reliable, distributed cluster computing environments. He enjoys reading a good paper with glass of scotch on a cold winter night. Given this winter, there's been a lot of papers :)</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/8/c/600_348067052.jpeg" /></p> <p>

      comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a> by Marc
      Shapiro, Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marek Zawirski (2011). </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://hal.upmc.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf">''A comprehensive
      study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types''</a> by Shapiro et
      al.</p> <p>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are a formalism for providing
      practical data and programming primitives for use in distributed systems applications
      without necessitating expensive (and sometimes impractical) consensus mechanisms.
       Their key characteristic is that they provide conflict-free "merging" of distributed
      concurrent updates given only the weak guarantees of eventual consistency.</p>
      <p><br/>While this paper did not coin the term ''CRDT'', it was the first to
      provide a comprehensive treatment of their definition, semantics, and possible
      construction separate from and beyond previous implementations of distributable
      datatypes that happened to provide CRDT-like semantics.</p> <p>In the paper,
      the authors:</p> <p>• Construct a modern taxonomy of data types that can be
      characterized has having desirable conflict-resolution properties given multiple
      distributed, concurrent actors manipulating shared data without coordination
      or consensus (a.k.a. "eventual consistency").</p> <p>• Describe a set of formal
      properties necessary to implement these data types, defining both local programming
      interfaces and distributed replication semantics and requirements.</p> <p><i>Related
      topics: Eventual consistency, consensus, CAP theorem, (semi-)lattices, Bloom(L),
      operational transforms, data replication</i></p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href="http://cemerick.com">Chas

    description: <p>In June, we have the pleasure of hearing Aysylu Greenberg, Software Engineer at Google and maintainer of the Clojure library <a href="https://github.com/aysylu/loom">Loom</a>, speaking on the paper "One VM to Rule Them All" by Thomas Wuerthinger, Christian Wimmer, et al.</p> <p><b>Paper</b></p> <p>You can find the paper in the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/bc15cfbe998b9dbde6c76480f9264e968e19155d/virtual_machines/README.md">PWL repository</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gkrichar/papers/onward2013-wuerthinger-truffle.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p><b>Intro</b></p> <p><br/>The paper explains how you can write an interpreter and get an optimizing just-in-time (JIT) compiler for free. This enables language designers to focus on features without worrying about the complexities of compiler optimizations and code generation. This paper presents a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that allows the application to control the JIT compiler behavior at runtime. We'll discuss how various programming languages can take advantage of this framework.</p> <p>To intrigue compiler aficionados, the authors show how combining AST node rewriting during interpretation, optimization, and deoptimization produces high performance code from the interpreter without a language-specific compiler. In addition, they present how features of a variety of programming languages, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, R and others, map on the framework.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/6/c/8/600_354266312.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><br/>Aysylu Greenberg has many hobbies. By day, she works on search infrastructure at Google. For fun, she writes open-source libraries in Clojure, ponders the design of systems that deal with inaccuracies, paints and sculpts. Her curiosity for everything new and unexplored drives her to seek out cutting edge research papers.

    description: '<p>We''re happy to have <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/model-analysis/">Erik
      Hinton</a>, developer at the New York Times, presenting on <a href="http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf">The
      Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of One-Hole Contexts</a> by Conor McBride.</p>
      <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Papers are generally loved for one of two reasons.
      Either the paper is foundational, siring a lineage of important research, or
      the paper is useful, guiding readers toward clever optimizations, fault-tolerant
      solutions, and non-intuitive hacks. "The Derivative of a Regular Type is its
      Type of One-Hole Contexts" is neither. Only a few papers build on McBride''s
      work and the conclusions of the paper, though promising, haven''t yet found
      any real employ.</p> <p>This paper is lovable, fun, and important because it
      is a radical thought experiment in the limits of abstraction. The paper poses
      the question: we call data types "algebraic", so can we "do calculus" on them?
      Surely, the nomenclature is just coincidental? What would it even mean to take
      the derivative of a data type? The paper stretches algebraic data types to what
      should be their breaking point and then demonstrates that it''s not a breaking
      point ay all. By considering the paper''s set-up and implications, we gain a
      deeper understanding of types and what they abstract. </p> <p>As it will turn
      out, you can take the derivative of data type and the result is meaningful.
      The derivative of an algebraic type is another data type, namely the type that
      can represent any specific context in the original type, any position in the
      original structure. This relationship is eerily similar to the relationship
      of functions to their derivatives (roughly, the contextual rate of change) that
      we all learned in high school. </p> <p>• No previous knowledge of calculus,
      algebraic data types, zippers, contexts or anything else is required.</p> <p>This
      talk will cover:</p> <p>- What is an algebraic data type? </p> <p>- What is
      a zipper and its sister structure, the one-hole context?</p> <p>- How can we
      derive a one-hole context from any given type? (How can we represent a specific
      location in an arbitrarily complex tree, type, etc)</p> <p>- What are the one-hole
      contexts of common types: the list, the binary tree, the ternary tree, and the
      rose tree?</p> <p>- Why would anyone care?</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Erik Hinton

      <p>My favorite problems are always those with the highest ratio of difficulty
      in solving to difficulty in stating.  The <i>lowest common ancestor</i> problem
      exemplifies this.  It was first stated in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800125.804056">1973</a>,
      and can be described to anyone in two sentences, or with one sentence and a
      picture.  But it took 11 years before an optimal solution was discovered, and
      another 16 before an understandable and implementable solution with the same
      bounds was presented, in this paper, <i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i>.  This
      problem is furthermore satisfying because its bounds are so tight: pre-processing
      takes as long as just reading the input, and queries are constant time.</p>
      <p><i>The LCA Problem Revisited</i> is a wonderfully curated journey through
      a deceptively simple problem that comes together in the end in a beautiful way,
      and it uses techniques that are powerful in plenty of other places.  Plus, it
      solves another bonus problem along the way!</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Leif Walsh

      Gap from Imperative to Functional Programming through Refactoring</a></i> by
      Alex Gyori, Lyle Franklin, Danny Dig, and Jan Lahoda.</p> <p><b>Intro</b></p>
      <p>The introduction of lambdas to Java 8 might be the most significant change
      to the Java language since Java 2 was released in 1998. Lambdas and the accompanying
      functional operations like map and filter promise to allow Java programmers
      to write clearer, simpler code, and to take better advantage of parallelism.</p>
      <p>While developers of new code will be able to start using the features immediately,
      what should we do with the billions of lines of code that have already been
      written? This paper proposes that we can automatically translate the existing
      body of Java code to make use of the new features.  This improves the readability
      of the old code, maintains consistency between new and old code, and potentially
      improves performance.</p> <p>This paper addresses technical debt, an area of
      software engineering which is only starting to be addressed in academic literature.
      The authors solve a practical and important problem with a powerful technical
      tool.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Peter Burka (<a href="https://twitter.com/pburka">@pburka</a>)
      is a member of the software research lab at Two Sigma Investments. He’s interested
      in many areas of software development, and has recently been dividing his time
      between exploring programming for many-core devices and finding ways to address
      technical debt through automation. Previously, he helped develop IBM’s J9 Java
      virtual machine, where he built the balanced garbage collector and ported the
      JVM to Palm Pilot, among other achievements. Peter has a great fondness for
      Smalltalk and is pleased that, 35 years on, its influence can still be seen
      in so many languages and systems.</p> <p><b>Paper Abstract</b></p> <p>Java 8
      introduces two functional features: lambda expressions and functional operations
      like map or filter that apply a lambda expression over the elements of a Collection.
      Refactoring existing code to use these new features enables explicit but unobtrusive
      parallelism and makes the code more succinct. However, refactoring is tedious:
      it requires changing many lines of code. It is also error-prone: the programmer
      must reason about the control-, data-flow, and side-effects. Fortunately, refactorings
      can be automated. We designed and implemented LambdaFicator, a tool which automates
      two refactorings. The first refactoring converts anonymous inner classes to
      lambda expressions. The second refactoring converts for loops that iterate over
      Collections to functional operations that use lambda expressions. Using 9 open-source
      projects, we have applied these two refactorings 1263 and 1709 times, respectively.
      The results show that LambdaFicator is useful: (i) it is widely applicable,
      (ii) it reduces the code bloat, (iii) it increases programmer productivity,
      and (iv) it is accurate.</p> <p><br/><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm;

      Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems</a> by Mike Burrows.</p>
      <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Distributed consensus is often discussed in terms
      of algorithms: Paxos, ZAB, RAFT, etc. But while the algorithms may be more or
      less mind-bending, for me the more interesting aspect of distributed consensus
      is creating systems that support it for the general use case. This paper, on
      Google''s Chubby lock service, is the story of happens when a system stops being
      a polite theory, and starts getting real-world use. </p> <p>To anyone who has
      worked in depth as a distributed systems engineer, Chubby is a beautiful paper.
      It is not a paper about algorithms and their limits, or a toy fringe system
      created by grad students to test a hypothesis. It is a paper that describes
      the real tradeoffs that real systems engineers make when designing something
      to solve a large set of problems well enough. This paper shows the key insights
      that the authors had as to how such a system might be used, and awareness of
      what it should do well, and what it should not try to do well. It details how
      Chubby was designed, but then goes further to describe how it ended up being
      used when released to the wild, and the surprises and consequences of these
      design decisions.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Camille Fournier (<a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">@skamille</a>)

Hoare. </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Our lives now run on software. Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected.</p> <p><br/>A single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees. C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness.</p> <p><br/>In this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas.

      at ProPublica, presenting <a href="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/ftp/pub/dec/SRC/publications/broder/positano-final-wpnums.pdf">On
      the resemblance and containment of documents</a> by Andrei Z. Broder.</p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p>
      <p>Increasingly Journalists are dealing with ever larger document dumps, and
      in order to find interesting stories in these troves, they have to cluster the
      documents to separate the wheat from the chaff. The size of these dumps often
      means that traditional algorithms either are too complex and take too long,
      or they rely on apriori constants like the number of clusters to search for.</p>
      <p>Jeff Larson will present a novel algorithm called minhashing that was invented
      at AltaVista in order to loosely cluster similar documents. The paper " On the
      resemblance and containment of documents" relies on a hash collisions to create
      document fingerprints and shows that documents can be clustered in linear time
      without knowledge of the entire document corpus. This algorithm has been a key
      tool in some of ProPublica''s biggest investigations, and has allowed reporters
      to shine light on topics such as political astroturfing and international money

      <p>We're extremely thrilled to host Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, presenting <b><a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/macromod.pdf">Composable and Compilable Macros</a> </b>by <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/">Matthew Flatt</a> of the University of Utah.<i></i></p> <p>













      <b>Intro</b></p> <p>


















      "<i>Composable and Compilable Macros</i>" introduces the Racket module system, which addresses the following problem: When you have macros that run programs at compile-time, how does this interact with separate compilation and ahead-of-time compilation. The paper introduces "phases", which enable Racket to behave the same regardless of when and how you compile your program. It also introduces the idea of writing different modules in different languages, which is now used for systems like Typed Racket.</p> <p>A few related papers:</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/LaSC-5-4-pp295-326.pdf">Syntactic Abstraction in Scheme</a>, Dybvig Hieb &amp; Bruggeman, Lisp andSymbolic Computation 1993</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/jfp12-draft-fcdf.pdf">Macros that Work Together</a>, Flatt, Findler, Culpepper, &amp; Darais, JFP 2012- Submodules in Racket, Flatt GPCE 2013</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/implicit-phasing.pdf">Implicit phasing for R6RS libraries</a>,  Ghuloum &amp; Dybvig, ICFP 2007</p> <p>- <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/popl99.pdf">Extending the scope of syntactic abstraction</a>, Waddell &amp; Dybvig, POPL 1999</p> <p>

      <p>We're riveted to have Andrew Turley, lead software engineer on the platform team at<a href="https://www.theladders.com/">TheLadders</a>, presenting<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/garbage_collection/incremental_mature_garbage_collection_using_the_train_algorithm.pdf?raw=true">Incremental Mature Garbage Collection Using the Train Algorithm</a> by Jacob Seligmann &amp; Steffen Grarup.  </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p><br/>Automatic garbage collection has spared programmers from an entire class of programming errors related to memory leaks and attempting to access objects that were incorrectly freed. As programs have grown in size and complexity, so have the systems that manage garbage collection. Each algorithm makes a different set of tradeoffs between factors such as the space used by objects, the space used by bookkeeping, the number of unused objects (garbage) that remain uncollected, the time spent in allocation, and the time spent in<br/>collection.</p> <p>The Train Algorithm is an incremental generational garbage collector that was designed to deal with the long and unpredictable pause times caused by other algorithms. It does this by grouping objects together on "cars" in "trains". The algorithm provides a strategy for moving objects from the younger generation into different cars, moving objects from one car to another, and collecting cars and trains. It was first described by Hudson and Moss in the paper "Incremental<br/>Collection of Mature Objects".</p> <p>In their paper "<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/garbage_collection/incremental_mature_garbage_collection_using_the_train_algorithm.pdf?raw=true">Incremental Mature Garbage Collection Using the Train Algorithm</a>," Seligmann and Grarup describe what they believe is the first implementation of the Train Algorithm, which they used to replace the traditional mark-and-sweep collector that was used in the BETA programming language. They discuss their implementation and present information about the performance characteristics of the new algorithm as compared to the original.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Andrew Turley (<a href="https://twitter.com/casio_juarez">@casio_juarez</a>) is a lead software engineer on the platform team at <a href="https://www.theladders.com/">TheLadders</a>, where he builds infrastructure by linking Storm topologies together using RabbitMQ. He has also had numerous professional brushes with lower levels of the software stack, including building embedded systems for processing audio at DigiDesign, and helping to improve the performance of iOS at<br/>Apple.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/4/a/600_433302314.jpeg" /></p> <p><i><b><a href="https://www.twosigma.com/">TwoSigma</a> </b>- Platinum Sponsor of the New York chapter</i></p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be refreshments of all kinds and pizza. </p> <p><br/>After Andrew presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p><br/>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/258">github-thread</a>* on the matter.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above (papers that you love!), please send us a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/pulls">pull request</a>.

      presenting on <a href="http://web.mit.edu/amdragon/www/pubs/commutativity-sosp13.pdf">The
      Scalable Commutativity Rule: Designing Scalable Software for Multicore Processors</a>
      by Clements, Kaashoek, Zeldovich, Morris, and Kohler.</p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p>
      <p><br/>Moore''s law is over, or at least, we won''t be making programs go faster
      by running on faster processors, but instead by parallelizing our code to use
      more of them.  Reasoning about concurrent code is difficult; but it''s also
      very hard to understand whether your design has latent scalability bottlenecks
      until you can actually run it on many cores.  And what if the problem is in
      your <i>interface, </i>instead of just the implementation?</p> <p>This paper
      presents a simple, elegant rule:  whenever interface operations commute, they
      can be implemented in a way that scales.  </p> <p><br/>The authors apply this
      idea to Linux, and create a new operating system by using the rule, sv6.  Their
      paper also comes with software, <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/commuter/">COMMUTER</a>,
      which can help developers evaluate their interfaces to find opportunities for
      scaling.</p> <p>This is a very powerful idea, and probably has applications
      in other areas like distributed systems. In this talk I''ll present the paper,
      and speculate a bit about where else this research could be useful.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p>
      <p>Neha Narula (<a href="https://twitter.com/neha">@neha</a>) is a PhD candidate

    description: '<p>We''re thrilled to have Samy Al Bahra, co-founder of <a href="http://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>
      and founder of <a href="http://concurrencykit.org/">Concurrency Kit</a>, presenting
      on <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/hart_ipdps06.pdf">Making
      Lockless Synchronization Fast: Performance Implications of Memory Reclamation</a> by
      Hart, McKenney, and Brown.</p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p><br/>Multicore systems
      are ubiquitous but modern concurrent programming techniques still do not see
      wide-spread adoption. Most concurrent software (developed in low-level languages)
      still relies on error-prone and unscalable memory management techniques for
      correctness despite the introduction of superior methods over 30 years ago.
      Safe memory reclamation allows for performant and robust memory management that
      is also suitable for advanced concurrent programming techniques such as non-blocking
      synchronization. If properly used, safe memory reclamation techniques allow
      improved performance and simplicity without the complexity of full-blown garbage
      collection.</p> <p>This paper provides a terrific overview of common safe memory
      reclamation mechanisms and then explores their performance implications. In
      this talk, I will do the same but with stronger emphasis on the introductory
      aspects of safe memory reclamation and contrast with a refreshed performance
      analysis.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Samy Al Bahra (<a href="https://twitter.com/0xf390">@0xf390</a>)
      is the co-founder of <a href="http://backtrace.io">Backtrace</a>, where he is
      helping build a modern debugging platform for today''s complex applications.
      Prior to Backtrace, Samy was a principal engineer at AppNexus, where he played
      a lead role in the architecture and development of many mission-critical components
      of the ecosystem. His work at AppNexus was instrumental in scaling the system
      to 18 billion impressions with orders of magnitude in efficiency improvements.
      Prior to AppNexus, Samy was behind major performance improvements to the core
      technology at Message Systems. At the George Washington University High Performance
      Computing Laboratory, Samy worked on the UPC programming language, heterogeneous
      computing and multicore synchronization. Samy is also the founder of the <a
      href="http://concurrencykit.org/">Concurrency Kit project</a>, which several
      leading technology companies rely on for scalability and performance. Samy serves
      on the ACM Practitioners Board.</p> <p><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Implementors use their intuition and qualitative judgements to choose one model or the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide, for the first time, a more substantial basis for this choice, based on our qualitative and quantitative experience of implementing both models in a state-of-the-art compiler for Haskell.</p> <p><br/>Our conclusion is simple, and contradicts our initial intuition: compiled implementations should use eval/apply.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href="https://about.me/jasonganetsky">Jason Ganetsky</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/ganetsky">@ganetsky</a>) is a software engineer at Google.

      <p>It's with great pleasure to announce that we'll have <a href="http://tomasp.net/">Tomas Petricek</a>, PhD student at University of Cambridge, functional programer, and F# enthusiast, presenting on the 1975 book -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Method">Against Method: Outline of an Anarchist Theory of Knowledge</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend">Paul Feyerabend</a>.</p> <p>This will be a little different! There's no open-access PDF version of the book around, but you can find at bookstores, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Against-Method-Paul-Feyerabend/dp/1844674428">Amazon</a>, or on the Internet... or so I've heard. </p> <p><b>Intro </b></p> <p>How is computer science research done? What we take for granted and what we question? And how do theories in computer science tell us something about the real world? Those are some of the questions that may inspire computer scientist like me (and you!) to look into philosophy of science. I’ll present the work of one of the more extreme (and interesting!) philosophers of science, Paul Feyerabend. In “Against Method”, Feyerabend looks at the history of science and finds that there is no fixed scientific methodology and the only methodology that can encompass the rich history is ‘anything goes’. We see (not only computer) science as a perfect methodology for building correct knowledge, but is this really the case? To quote Feyerabend: </p> <p><i><b>Science is much more 'sloppy' and 'irrational' than its methodological image.</b></i></p> <p>I’ll be mostly talking about Paul Feyerabend’s “Against Method”, but as a computer scientist myself, I’ll insert a number of examples based on my experience with theoretical programming language research. I hope to convince you that looking at philosophy of science is very much worthwhile if we want to better understand what we do and how we do it as computer scientists!</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href="http://michaelrbernste.in">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net"&gt;Tomas Petricek</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">@tomaspetricek</a>) recently submitted his PhD thesis at University of Cambridge on context-aware programming languages.

      <p>We're delighted to have our old friend, Tom Santero, software engineer at Helium and current FOCO resident, presenting on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/buridan.pdf">Buridan's Principle</a>, a paper by Turing Award-winner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a>.</p> <p><b>Intro </b></p> <p>In 1984 Leslie Lamport began to observe the glitch problem [0] occurs in everyday life. Realizing this phenomenon had not been discussed by psychologists of the day, he set out to describe his observations using the classical formalization of Buridan's ass. Lamport initially failed to have this paper published in various scientific journals, being rejected on grounds of superficiality. It wasn't until 2011, when a reader suggested he resubmit to Foundations of Physics, that the paper was eventually published.</p> <p>Those familiar with the works of Lamport know him as a logician, his life's work has pushed forward the state of the art in areas of mutual exclusion and distributed systems probably more than any other, and so reading Buridan's Principle might strike us as a bit odd, or even obscure. We're in unfamiliar territory with Lamport. Nonetheless, in this paper, Lamport's casual observations lead him to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences, providing us readers with what appears to be a universal law of nature: Buridan's Principle. </p> <p>[0] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf"><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf" class="linkified">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href="http://michaelrbernste.in">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net"&gt;</a></p> <p>Tom Santero (<a href="https://twitter.com/tsantero">@tsantero</a>) is a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.helium.com">Helium Systems</a>, writing Haskell and Erlang to connect things to the internet.

      <p>We're **crazy** excited to have <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/">Bryan Cantrill</a>, CTO of Joyent, formerly of Sun Microsystems, presenting on <i><a href="https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/bcantrill/public/ppwl-cantrill-jails.pdf">Jails: Confining the omnipotent root.</a> </i>by Poul-Henning Kamp and Robert Watson and <i><a href="https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/bcantrill/public/ppwl-cantrill-zones.pdf">Solaris Zones: Operating System Support for Consolidating Commercial Workloads</a> </i>by Dan Price and Andy Tucker!</p> <p><br/>You can also catch Bryan presenting at the <a href="http://containersummit.io/events/nyc-2016">NYC Container Summit</a> on February 10th, which also is hosting an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/container-summit-advanced-technical-track-tickets-20708946015">advanced technical track</a>, which includes hand-on tutorials! Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc">watch this amazing illumos presentation</a> by Bryan in 2011! </p> <p><br/><b>Abstracts</b></p> <p>Jails: Confining the omnipotent root.</p> <p><br/>===========================</p> <p>The traditional UNIX security model is simple but inexpressive. Adding fine-grained access control improves the expressiveness, but often dramatically increases both the cost of system management and implementation complexity. In environments with a more complex management model, with delegation of some management functions to parties under varying degrees of trust, the base UNIX model and most natural extensions are inappropriate at best. Where multiple mutually untrusting parties are introduced, ‘‘inappropriate’’ rapidly transitions to‘‘nightmarish’’, especially with regards to data integrity and privacy protection. The FreeBSD ‘‘Jail’’ facility provides the ability to partition the operating system environment, while maintaining the simplicity of the UNIX‘‘root’’ model. In Jail, users with privilege find that the scope of their requests is limited to the jail, allowing system administrators to delegate management capabilities for each virtual machine environment. Creating virtual machines in this manner has many potential uses; the most popular thus far has been for providing virtual machine services in Internet Service Provider environments.</p> <p><br/>Solaris Zones: Operating System Support for Consolidating Commercial Workloads</p> <p><br/>===========================================</p> <p>Server consolidation, which allows multiple workloads to run on the same system, has become increasingly important as a way to improve the utilization of computing resources and reduce costs. Consolidation is common in mainframe environments, where technology to support running multiple workloads and even multiple operating systems on the same hardware has been evolving since the late 1960’s. This technology is now becoming an important differentiator in the UNIX and Linux server market as well, both at the low end (virtual web hosting) and high end(traditional data center server consolidation).This paper introduces Solaris Zones (zones), a fully realized solution for server consolidation projects in a commercial UNIX operating system. By creating virtualized application execution environments within a single instance of the operating system, the facility strikes a unique balance between competing requirements. On the one hand, a system with multiple workloads needs to run those workloads in isolation, to ensure that applications can neither observe data from other applications nor affect their operation. It must also prevent applications from over-consuming system resources. On the other hand, the system as a whole has to be flexible, manageable, and observable, in order to reduce administrative costs and increase efficiency. By focusing on the support of multiple application environments rather than multiple operating system instances, zones meets isolation requirements without sacrificing manageability.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href="http://michaelrbernste.in">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomasp.net"&gt;</a></p> <p>Bryan Cantrill is the CTO at Joyent, where he oversees worldwide development of the <a href="http://smartos.org/">SmartOS</a> and <a href="https://www.joyent.com/private-cloud">SmartDataCenter</a> platforms, and the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> platform. Prior to joining Joyent, Bryan served as a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, where he spent over a decade working on system software, from the guts of the kernel to client-code on the browser. In particular, he co-designed and implemented DTrace, a facility for dynamic instrumentation of production systems that won the Wall Street Journal's top Technology Innovation Award in 2006 and the USENIX Software Tools User Group Award in 2008. Bryan also co-founded the Fishworks group at Sun, where he designed and implemented the DTrace-based analytics facility for the Sun Storage 7000 series of appliances.</p> <p><br/>Bryan received the ScB magna cum laude with honors in Computer Science from Brown University.</p> <p><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/4/a/600_433302314.jpeg" /></p> <p>

      Allspaw</a>, CTO of <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> and author, presenting
      on <a href="http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf">Common
      Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity</a> by Klein, Feltovich, and Woods.</p>
      <p><b>Intro </b></p> <p>The paper I''m going to discuss is the result of what
      happens when people with backgrounds in mathematics, psychology, and artificial
      intelligence (Feltovich and Bradshaw) get together to ask questions about how
      teams operate alongside the originators of modern decision-making and cognitive
      systems engineering research (Klein and Woods). </p> <p>The concepts outlined
      in the paper have provided frames and directions in designing tools and environments
      where successful work requires multiple actors (whether they are people or software
      agents!) to succeed. This seminal paper takes a deep dive into not just people
      and teamwork, but what comprises the sometimes invisible activity of coordination,
      collaboration, cooperation, and the contracts and expectations entities have
      with each other along the way. </p> <p>The paper has had far-reaching influence
      in multiple domains: military intelligence, space transportation and aviation,
      and more recently: software engineering and operations on the web. Let me walk
      you through where this paper came from, what makes this paper critical to the
      future of software, and a hint about what I''m sure it means about the future. </p>

      on <a href="http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf">Mastering
      the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search</a>:</p> <p><i>The
      game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for
      artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space and the difficulty
      of evaluating board positions and moves. We introduce a new approach to computer
      Go that uses value networks to evaluate board positions and policy networks
      to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination
      of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from
      games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go
      at the level of state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo tree search programs that simulate
      thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm
      that combines Monte-Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this
      search algorithm,our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other
      Go programs,and defeated the European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the
      first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player
      in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade
      away.</i></p> <p><br/>- Eric Brewer presenting on <b><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/Mesa.pdf">Experience
      with Processes and Monitors in Mesa</a></b>:</p> <p><br/><i>The use of monitors
      for describing concurrency has been much discussed in the literature. When monitors
      are used in real systems of any size, however, a number of problems arise which
      have not been adequately dealt with: the semantics of nested monitor calls;
      the various ways of defining the meaning of WAIT; priority scheduling; handling
      of timeouts, aborts and other exceptional conditions; interactions with process
      creation and destruction; monitoring large numbers of small objects. These problems
      are addressed by the facilities described here for concurrent programming in
      Mesa. Experience with several substantial applications gives us some confidence
      in the validity of our solutions.</i></p> <p><br/>-  Ines Sombra presenting
      on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/255833/IronFleet-twocol.pdf"><b>IronFleet:
      Proving Practical Distributed Systems Correct</b></a>:</p> <p><br/><i>Distributed
      systems are notorious for harboring subtle bugs.Verification can, in principle,
      eliminate these bugs a priori,but verification has historically been difficult
      to apply at full program scale, much less distributed-system scale.We describe
      a methodology for building practical and provably correct distributed systems
      based on a unique blend of TLA-style state-machine refinement and Hoare-logic
      verification.We demonstrate the methodology on a complex implementation of a
      Paxos-based replicated state machine library and a lease-based sharded key-value
      store. We prove that each obeys a concise safety specification, as well as desirable
      liveness requirements. Each implementation achieves performance competitive
      with a reference system. With our methodology and lessons learned, we aim to
      raise the standard for distributed systems from “tested” to “correct.” </i></p>
      <p><br/>-  Caitie McCaffrey presenting on <b><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf">Simple
      Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures...</a></b>:</p> <p><br/><i>Large,
      production quality distributed systems still fail periodically,and do so sometimes
      catastrophically, where most or all users experience an outage or data loss.
      We present the result of a comprehensive study investigating198 randomly selected,
      user-reported failures that occurred on Cassandra, HBase, Hadoop Distributed
      FileSystem (HDFS), Hadoop MapReduce, and Redis, with the goal of understanding
      how one or multiple faults eventually evolve into a user-visible failure. We
      found that from a testing point of view, almost all failures require only 3
      or fewer nodes to reproduce, which is good news considering that these services
      typically run on avery large number of nodes. However, multiple inputs are needed
      to trigger the failures with the order between them being important. Finally,
      we found the error logs of these systems typically contain sufficient data on
      both the errors and the input events that triggered the failure,enabling the
      diagnose and the reproduction of the production failures. </i></p> <p><i>We
      found the majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented
      by performing simple testing on error handling code – the last line of defense
      – even without an understanding of the software design. We extracted three simple
      rules from the bugs that have lead to some of the catastrophic failures, and
      developed a static checker, Aspirator, capable of locating these bugs. Over30%
      of the catastrophic failures would have been prevented had Aspirator been used
      and the identified bugs fixed. Running Aspirator on the code of 9 distributed
      systems located 143 bugs and bad practices that have been fixed or confirmed
      by the developers.</i></p> <p><br/><b>Bios</b></p> <p>- Evelina (Gabasova) is

      <p><i>7:50 ~ -&gt;</i>Deniz Altınbüken on Chain Replication (old and new)</p>
      <p><b>Talks</b></p> <p>• <i><b>Chain Replication</b></i></p> <p><i>Chain Replication
      (CR)</i> is a variant of Primary-Backup Replication that supports high throughput
      and fast recovery from failures.  CR has been widely used in both commercial
      systems and academic research prototypes. In so doing, various shortcomings
      of the original CR protocol have come to light. In this talk, I will summarize
      these findings and present a new version of CR that addresses the shortcomings.
       Our improved CR protocol supports different consistency guarantees, avoids
      the tail bottleneck for reads, and introduces autonomous reconfiguration of
      the system without requiring an external master. Additionally, we have developed
      a formal end-to-end specification of the protocol, including the actions of
      clients, detailing reconfiguration and linearizable execution of client requests.
      Through this specification, we are able to reason about the new protocol more
      precisely and implement the protocol effortlessly.  Lastly, I will contrast
      our approach to the related work.  </p> <p>• <b>Tiered Replication</b></p> <p>Tiered
      Replication, by Cidon et. al, explores the problem of effective data replication
      strategies first introduced in the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc15/atc15-paper-cidon.pdf">Copysets
      paper</a>, awarded <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc15/technical-session/presentation/cidon">2013
      Usenix ATC Best Student Paper</a>. While Copysets introduced a randomized algorithm
      for solving NP Hard redundancy and load balancing constraints around placement
      of data in distributed filesystem, Tiered Replication proposes a greedy algorithm
      for solving the same problem and also adding the ability to bake in real world
      constraints such as rack awareness. Wes will summarize the problem Copysets
      proposed, show <a href="https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/trepl">Tiered Replication’s
      solution</a>, and examine a real world deployment of the algorithm at Chartbeat.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We present a functional approach to parsing unrestricted
      context-free grammars based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brzozowski_derivative">Brzozowski''s
      derivative of regular expressions</a>. If we consider context-free grammars
      as recursive regular expressions, Brzozowski''s equational theory extends without
      modification to context-free grammars (and it generalizes to parser combinators).
      The supporting actors in this story are three concepts familiar to functional
      programmers - laziness, memoization and fixed points; these allow Brzozowski''s
      original equations to be transliterated into purely functional code in about
      30 lines spread over three functions.</p> <p>Yet, this almost impossibly brief
      implementation has a drawback: its performance is sour - in both theory <i>and </i>practice.
      The culprit? Each derivative can <i>double</i> the size of a grammar, and with
      it, the cost of the next derivative.</p> <p>Fortunately, much of the new structure
      inflicted by the derivative is either dead on arrival, or it dies after the
      very next derivative. To eliminate it, we once again exploit laziness and memoization
      to transliterate an equational theory that prunes such debris into working code.
      Thanks to this compaction, parsing times become reasonable in practice.</p>
      <p>We equip the functional programmer with two equational theories that, when
      combined, make for an abbreviated understanding and implementation of a system
      for parsing context-free languages.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><i><a href="http://swannodette.github.io/">David

    description: <p>It's with great pleasure to announce that we'll be hosting Elizabeth Ramirez, a senior software engineer at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> and M.S. candidate in <a href="http://apam.columbia.edu/">Applied Mathematics at Columbia University</a>. She'll be presenting on a classic: <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/media/pdf/Kalman1960.pdf">A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems</a> by Rudolf Kálmán. Kálmán, who <a href="http://hungarytoday.hu/news/renowned-hungarian-scientis-rudolf-kalman-dies-aged-86-46732">passed away in July</a>, was <a href="http://ethw.org/Rudolf_E._Kalman">a luminary</a> who shaped the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#Modern_control_theory">modern control theory</a>. </p> <p>There are many <i>Kalman Filter</i> tutorials to be found on the web, such as <a href="http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/"><a href="http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/" class="linkified">http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/</a></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/k_MpfzMc9PU">Elizabeth gave a great talk at PyCon</a> this year on implementing a discrete <i>Kalman Filter</i> in Python:</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_MpfzMc9PU" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_MpfzMc9PU</a></p> <p><b>Intro </b></p> <p>The <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter">Kalman Filter</a> </i>is a prediction-correction algorithm named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_E._K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n">Rudolf E. Kálmán</a> (1930-2016), by which we calculate recursively a dynamical system state at time <i>t_{k}</i> using state at previous time <i>u_{k-1}</i> and new information <i>b_{k}</i> only. This technique is presented as a generalization of the least squares model for problems with varying mean and additive noise.</p> <p>The <i>Kalman Filter</i> was first applied in the 1960s to the problem of trajectory estimation for NASA's Apollo space program and incorporated into their space navigation computer. It is also used in the guidance and navigation systems of the NASA Space Shuttle and the attitude control and navigation systems of the International Space Station. In other words, it is mostly used for positioning and navigation systems, but it can be generalized to any time series under suitable conditions.</p> <p>Rudolf Kálmán recently passed away, and I thought it was a good idea to honor his memory at Papers We Love by presenting his original paper published in 1960, "<a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/media/pdf/Kalman1960.pdf">A New Approach to Linear Filtering and Prediction Problems</a>", aka <i>Kalman Filter</i>.</p> <p><b>Bio<br/></b></p> <p>Elizabeth Ramirez (<a href="https://twitter.com/eramirem">@eramirem</a>) is a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> and M.S. candidate in <a href="http://apam.columbia.edu/">Applied Mathematics at Columbia University</a>.

The problem is that generating increasingly realistic renderings requires a lot of processing and so a tradeoff must be made between compute time and image quality. We will first look at two foundational papers from the 70s that built “good enough” models that were fast to render. Finally, we look at <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S08/lectures/kajiya.pdf">The Rendering Equation</a> that provides a single model to encompass many effects of lighting assuming you are willing to pay the processing cost.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio<br/></b></p> <p><a href="https://wyegelwel.github.io">Wil Yegelwel</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/WYegelwel">@WYegelwel</a>) is an engineer at <a href="https://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a> working on the Compute team.

      Integral Convolution</a> is one of the most intuitive data visualization techniques

       to visualize a vector field simply take an image and have the vector field
      smear the colors.  The result is a powerful alternative to using arrows or stream
      lines.  And while the intuition is very straightforward, the actual mathematics
      that power the technique are very complex.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/4/2/600_458197954.jpeg"

      sewing (<a href="https://kiranbot.com/tags/sewing/" class="linkified">https://kiranbot.com/tags/sewing/</a>)!
      She''ll be presenting on a survey of work related to failure detectors for distributed
      systems.</p> <p>Intro</p> <p>The problem of consensus is central to many distributed
      systems algorithms. Failure detectors are central to the way we think about
      consensus algorithms. In a fully asynchronous system, the FLP impossibility
      result (<a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf" class="linkified">https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf</a>)
      shows that no consensus solution that can tolerate crash failures exists! This
      simple, stunning result imposed a hard constraint on what could be solved in
      an asynchronous model.</p> <p>The FLP (<a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/"
      class="linkified">http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/</a>)
      result kicked off a flurry of research into ways to circumvent the impossibility
      result. Failure detectors were the most compelling abstraction proposed. These
      augmented the asynchronous model just enough to allow consensus, while retaining
      most of the neat abstractions that make asynchronous systems simple to reason
      about.</p> <p>In this talk, I''ll discuss some of the history and background
      of Chandra and Toueg''s failure detector proposal (<a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.852/08/papers/CT96-JACM.pdf"
      class="linkified">http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.852/08/papers/CT96-JACM.pdf</a>),
      and discuss some failure detector mechanisms that followed the paper.</p> <p>Bio</p>

      Turley''s lightning talk</i>:</p> <p>In 1960, two different computers compiled
      and ran the same COBOL program. Twenty-five years later COBOL was considered
      a grand success in industry and was barely mentioned, except critically, in
      academia. Shneiderman looks at COBOL''s relationship to industry and academia,
      discusses COBOL''s strengths and weaknesses, and describes the contributions
      that it made to the fields of computer science and computer engineering.</p>
      <p>This paper draws heavily from Jean Sammet''s "<a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/the-early-history-of-cobol-S4iP58UtHc?articleList=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DThe%2Bearly%2Bhistory%2Bof%2BCOBOL">An

      href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1198367" class="linkified">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1198367</a></a>).
      Reading Sammet''s paper is not required to understand what Shneiderman is talking
      about, but it does provide a great deal of additional background information.</p>

      menagerie of auctions — single dimensional, multi-dimensional, single sided,
      double sided, first price, second price, English, Dutch, Japanese, sealed bid
      — and these have been extensively discussed and analyzed in the economics literature.
      We will survey this literature from a computer science perspective, primarily
      from the viewpoint of computer scientists who are interested in learning about
      auction theory, and to provide pointers into the economics literature for those
      who want a deeper technical understanding. We''ll also take a peek into how

      <i>Sophia Gold''s lightning talk</i>:</p> <p><br/><i><b>An Intellectual History
      of Automatic Differentiation</b></i> traces the research surrounding a collection
      of techniques for computing derivatives without using either approximation or
      the manipulation of subscript-filled equations used to terrorize high school
      students. While its simplicity gives this method the mystery of "deep magic,"
      it has its roots in work on differential equations in the late 19th century;
      inspired Alonzo Church''s discovery of the untyped lambda calculus; influenced
      the development of functional programming, concurrency, and Unix in the 1970s;
      and has been recently rediscovered with applications to type theory, modelling
      stochastic processes, and training recurrent neural networks.</p> <p><br/><i>References</i></p>

      <p>Sam L'ecuyer will present <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/fournet/papers/join-tutorial.pdf">The Join Calculus: a Language for Distributed Mobile Programming</a>, by Cedric Fournet and Georges Gonthier.</p> <p>

      --</p> <p>Do semaphores and mutexes, distributed locks and clocks confound you? Does concurrency as an afterthought frustrate and bewilder you? In this paper, Fournet and Gonthier present the join calculus, a modeling language for clean, asynchronous distributed computing. This language builds upon well established techniques of pattern matching, static typing, and local variable declaration to lay the foundation for synchronizing data across multiple machines, code mobility, and failure detection.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Sam L'ecuyer (<a href="https://twitter.com/cateches">@cateches</a>) is a front-end engineer at Yahoo.  You can find a lot of the code he writes at <a href="https://screen.yahoo.com">screen.yahoo.com</a>. He enjoys static typing, text editors from the 1970s, and making his own cocktail bitters.</p>

      Protocols: Why We Want Them And What Else They Can Do"</a> by Kiczales, Ashley,
      Rodriguez, Vahdat &amp; Bobrow.</p> <p>Abstraction is one of the pillars of
      computer science. Software has traditionally been constructed according to the
      principle that a module should expose its functionality but hide its implementation.
      This principle, informally known as black-box abstraction, is a basic tenet
      of software design, underlying our approaches to portability, reuse,and many
      other important issues in computing. However, in some cases black-box abstraction
      causes the very problems it is supposed to eliminate.</p> <p>As a programming
      languages becomes higher and higher level, its implementation in terms of the
      underlying machines involves more and more trade-offs on the part of the implementer,
      about what cases to optimize at the expense of other cases. This leaves a programmer
      victim to inefficiencies driving them to break language abstractions and "code
      between the lines" making code more complex and less portable.</p> <p>Meta-object
      protocols are a principled way of getting the most out of abstraction. It is
      a way to allow the end-programmer to go back and remake design tradeoffs to
      better suite their needs. In addition Meta-object protocols are an extremely
      fascinating and elegant formalism.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Thanks again to Brainium

      <p>This month Bill will present "No Silver Bullet" by Fred Brooks. <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf">link</a></p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p><br/>Some thirty years after Turing Award winner Fred Brooks’ seminal work 'No Silver Bullet' was published, the industry has paved over his enthusiastic skepticism, with an air of pessimism and apathy.  After tearing down the failed software development methodologies of our predecessors, I will leverage Brooks’ work to frame a critique of current industry themes such as DevOps, Microservices, and Cloud Computing.  Lest however, you be consumed by an unshakable hopelessness that, as an industry, we are bound to Santayana’s Sisyphean prophesy (‘those who don’t learn from history are bound to repeat it’), I will show that Brooks’ theories are alive, well and in fact thriving in niche communities paving our way forward.</p> <p>



      About Bill:</p> <p>In a previous life, Bill (<a href="https://twitter.com/williamberryiii">@williamberryiii</a>) crafted scenery for Broadway, a la Pirates of Penzance, but now crafts software for the enterprise, a la Pirates of Silicon Valley. In his roles as Technical Lead and Application Architect for The Retail Equation, Bill has lead service integrations with Fortune 500 retailers, curated DevOps initiatives and always enjoys building high performance, multi-tenant distributed data APIs. As a deeply curious engineer, he enjoys pairing complex problems with simple and elegant solutions. Striving for meaningful change, Bill believes that cultural and technical progress is best made through evolution and not revolution.</p> <p><br/>---</p> <p>Food and drinks will be provided by DSC.</p> <p>A huge thank you to <a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar Shave Club</a> for sponsoring this month's meetup!</p>

      <p>This month we have Paul Snively presenting "<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/history.html#propositions-as-types">Propositions as Types</a>" at Yahoo's brand new Playa Vista campus.  Food and drink will be provided.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Philip Wadler may be the most important computer scientist you’ve never heard of. However, as principal designer of the Haskell programming language, co-designer of generics in Java with Scala designer Martin Odersky, co-designer of XQuery for the W3C, and prolific (and humorous, cf. ’Threesomes, with and without blame’ from POPL 2010) writer and speaker, there is little doubt he has influenced you if you write software. His recent (March 2014) paper, ‘<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/history.html#propositions-as-types">Propositions as Types</a>,’ is his survey of the relationship between propositions, as in mathematical logic, and types, as in statically-typed programming language. Together, we’ll explore how and why this relationship is broad, deep, and mysterious; how it may shape new and future programming languages and possibly affect STEM education; and maybe even shed a little light (and hopefully a little less heat) on why some users of statically-typed languages are so adamant about it.</p> <p>



      Paul Snively is an architect for Verizon OnCue, working in Scala in a purely functional fashion. He loves both building things other people use and thinking about how and why the things he builds work, and like many other people, has discovered that the best way to learn is to try to teach, so he led a workshop on formal logic at the Scala World conference in 2015, which he later re-recorded as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KWcuhX-QTg">screencast</a>; he discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWTWkYbcWU0">Type Systems: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</a> at the Strange Loop conference in 2014 with Amanda Laucher; and he discussed <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Types-Tests">Types vs. Tests: An Epic Battle?</a> at the Strange Loop conference in 2012, also with Amanda Laucher.</p> <p><br/>--</p> <p>Thank you to Yahoo for hosting us!</p>

All of them are based on functional programming principles, yet some of their users are not aware of that influence.<br/>John Huges back in the 90s presented the idea that since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional programming matters because it enables well structured and easy to debug software.<br/>This presentation will revisit his paper and compare how these principles are being applied in the new "Reactive technologies" and why Functional Programming Matters.</p> <p>

      --</p> <p>Since the days where computers had green screens, Gonzalo has been hacking any turing-complete device he has stumbled upon, from Apple IIs to Mesos Clusters in AWS.

In addition, the information content of a program is spread over several different layers of abstraction. Superficially (and in our typical mode of interaction with an editor) a program is a sequence of characters, where its syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and apobetic layers lay latent under deeper layers of abstraction.</p> <p><i>Epitaxis </i>is a language independent system designed to reify these layers of abstraction so they can be queried and reasoned over to allow software to be dealt with at the appropriate level of abstraction. In an analogous way that programs are used to model other systems, <i>Epitaxis </i>models software to allow access to its lexical, syntactic, and semantic layers, exposing execution state space to search and automated reasoning. In addition to funding bugs and aiding in understanding complex software this platform can be used to do machine learning over execution state space, and possibly a virtual environment for a machine agent to learn and explore software.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Food and drink will be provided by Yahoo.</p>

The discussion ranges in tone from sanitized mathematical descriptions of field equations to humorous rhetorical musings on the fate of the universe in different scenarios. Despite its brevity and age, Coleman and Luccia's work continues to serve as a reference and inspiration for work in gravitation and cosmology today.  </p> <p><a href="https://www.sns.ias.edu/pitp2/2011files/PhysRevD.21.3305.pdf"><a href="https://www.sns.ias.edu/pitp2/2011files/PhysRevD.21.3305.pdf" class="linkified">https://www.sns.ias.edu/pitp2/2011files/PhysRevD.21.3305.pdf</a></a></p>

      /></p> <p>Matthew Colborn in Pluralism and the Mind (2011) wrote:</p> <p>“The
      major dilemma for Western science – and those who follow it – is how to fit
      subjective experiences in to a larger world-view that at least appears to preclude
      them.</p> <p>As the philosopher John Searle put it:</p> <p>“How can we square
      [the] self-conception of ourselves as mindful, meaning-creating, free, rational,
      etc. agents with a universe that consists of entirely mindless, meaningless,
      unfree, nonrational, brute physical particles?”.</p> <p>Searle is claiming that
      the background assumptions of Western science conflict in some fundamental way
      with our everyday view of ourselves.”</p> <p>As expressed by Colborn (and Searle),
      there is a discordance between the science we use to understand the world and
      how we view and understand ourselves as living beings. Can this be resolved
      by improving (and expanding) what science can express without resorting to vitalism
      or mysticism?</p> <p>Not many people have heard of Robert Rosen. He was a theoretical
      biologist who spent his entire career trying to understand life. His research
      was to answer the question: “What is it about certain material systems that
      confers upon them the characteristics of life, which makes them living beings?”
      In order to approach an answer, Rosen was forced to investigate how it is that
      science answers questions. This lead him to a deep study of the Newtonian Paradigm
      and what can and cannot be understood in its terms. Rosen formulated a language
      based on Category Theory that reaches beyond Newtonian mechanics to answer the
      question “How is an organism different from a machine?” His work spans numerous
      books, book chapters, and many scientific papers.</p> <p>Donald Mikulecky’s
      paper “Robert Rosen: The Well-Posed Question and its Answer – Why Are Organisms
      Different from Machines?” is one of the best overviews of Rosen’s work.</p>
      <p>This talk will take a journey through this fascinating and controversial
      territory.</p> <p><a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mikuleck/PPRISS3.html"

    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</p>
    <p>We're curating a repository for papers and places-to-find papers. You can contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>
    <p>If you need to reach out to us or have ideas for papers, just ask us via our <a href="https://twitter.com/paperswelove_la">twitter account</a>.

It was first published in The Atlantic in July 1945 and republished in an abridged version in September 1945—before and after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of collective memory machine with his concept of the memex that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.</p> <p>

      <p>Monoids: Theme and Variations (Functional Pearl)</p> <p><br/><a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/cis_papers/762/"><a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/cis_papers/762/" class="linkified">http://repository.upenn.edu/cis_papers/762/</a></a></p> <p>Presented by Jesse Williamson, Developer of soft wares, Scripter of Javas.</p> <p><br/><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>The monoid is a humble algebraic structure, at first glance even downright boring. However, there’s much more to monoids than meets the eye. Using examples taken from the diagrams vector graphics framework as a case study, I demonstrate the power and beauty of monoids for library design. The paper begins with an extremely simple model of diagrams and proceeds through a series of incremental variations, all related somehow to the central theme of monoids. Along the way, I illustrate the power of compositional semantics; why you should also pay attention to the monoid’s even humbler cousin, the semigroup; monoid homomorphisms; and monoid actions.</p> <p>

It provides strong consistency for all transactions. This combination of availability and consistency over the wide area is generally considered impossible due to the CAP Theorem. We show how Spanner achieves this combination and why it is consistent with CAP. We also explore the role that TrueTime, Google's globally synchronized clock, plays in consistency for reads and especially for snapshots that enable consistent and repeatable analytics.</p> <p>Street parking on 6th, 7th &amp; 8th Avenues <i>north</i> of B Street is usually easy at that hour.

    <p>If you'd like to present a paper please fill out this form:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaI-fWdys27-ByT_HdtsJ73V4AxZr0hf1GSqLsQ1IwAaPdIQ/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaI-fWdys27-ByT_HdtsJ73V4AxZr0hf1GSqLsQ1IwAaPdIQ/viewform</a></p>
    <p>This meetup is a chapter of&nbsp;<a href="http://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love</a>. The general format is that once a month one member will present one computer science paper using e.g. speech, slides, demonstration. Attendees are encouraged, but not required, to read and digest the paper in advance of the meeting.</p>
    <p>One goal is to help bridge the gap between San Diego industry and academics: membership of both types are very welcome. Another goal is to dive deep into interesting programming topics: new and old (but still relevant).</p>
    <p><span>We require adherence to the </span><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Papers We Love Code of Conduct</a> <br></p>

      <p>In 2004 DHH <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/107370">announced</a> the initial release for Rails. This year <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/98cb3e69afd687f7c0d4bc48eabf284da691abcc#commitcomment[masked]">marks ten years</a> since its release.</p> <p>Let's celebrate this occasion by holding a launch party on 26th April 2014.</p> <p>Rails 4.1 will be out at Railsconf this year. Considering that there have been major changes from 3x onwards to 4.0 - 4.1, we plan to do a small workshop, focusing on new features with 4.1.</p> <p>The workshop will focus on new things like:</p> <p>• Reviewing ActiveRecord concepts.</p> <p>• Mailer Preview</p> <p>• Message Verifier</p> <p>• JSON Encoder changes</p> <p>• Security changes like secrets.yml</p> <p>• Spring/Binstubs etc</p> <p>


      Ruby 2.1.1 also turns a page with exciting new features. We'll try to go briefly over some of them.</p> <p>Come join us for the workshop and Rails 4.1 Launch party, celebrating 10 years of Rails!</p> <p>UPDATE: There will be Lunch and Cake, sponsored by <a href="http://bigbinary.com">BigBinary</a> and <a href="http://revealinghour.in">Revealing Hour Creations</a>. Thanks to these amazing folks!</p>

What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</i></p> <p><b>If you have read a paper and found it really interesting and want share your thoughts on it - welcome!</b></p> <p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/33-hints/WebPage.html">Hints for Computer System Design</a>, Presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/neeran">Neeran</a></p> <p><br/>Does this sound fun? </p>

He will give an introduction to textbook examples of TLA+ and, if time allows, he will also show us real-world TLA+ specifications (e.g. the one for the raft consenus protocol).</p> <p>We think it sounds very exciting and fits well with the last meetup's subject!</p> <p>Links about the subject for ones who want to come prepared:</p> <p>- <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/amazon.html"><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/amazon.html" class="linkified">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/amazon.html</a></a><br/>- <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html"><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html" class="linkified">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html</a></a><br/>- Resources from <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tlaplus"><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tlaplus" class="linkified">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tlaplus</a></a><br/>- TLA+ spec for Raft at <a href="https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla"><a href="https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla" class="linkified">https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla</a></a></p> <p>

      <b>Title</b><br/>A primer on TLA+ and its applications </p> <p><b><br/>Abstract</b><br/>We have a fast deep dive into Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) and its associated tools (TLA+). TLA+helps to formally specify systems with simple mathematics, then verify certain properties and provehow they work. We go through an example to start using TLA+ including a specification and using the model checker. We try to provide examples on how/why using TLA+ is crucial in many softwareengineering domains. We will have an open discussion on how using TLA+ could fill the gaps indaily software engineering challenges. If time allows, we look at the TLA+ spec of a well-knowndistributed systems algorithm.<br/>You can find the slides and resources for this talk on GitHub's repo for PwL Utrecht after thetalk.</p> <p>

      <p><b>Title</b></p> <p>A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels</p> <p><br/><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <p>ANSI SQL-92 defines Isolation Levels in terms of phenomena: Dirty Reads,
      Non-Repeatable Reads, and Phantoms. This paper shows that these phenomena and
      the ANSI SQL definitions fail to characterize several popular isolation levels,
      including the standard locking implementations of the levels. Investigating
      the ambiguities of the phenomena leads to clearer definitions; in addition new
      phenomena that better characterize isolation types are introduced. An important
      multiversion isolation type, Snapshot Isolation, is defined.</p> <p><b>Target
      audience</b></p> <p>The presentation is intended for those who understand the
      concepts of threads, transactions, concurrency and databases. The motivation
      behind the talk is to provide the basis necessary for understanding the challenges
      in heavy-load systems as well as systems involving parallel data storage. </p>

      <p><br/>Games and Ray Tracing: a follow-up on Ingo Wald''s Ph.D. thesis "Realtime
      Ray Tracing and Interactive Global Illumination".</p> <p><br/><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <p>Generating 3D images for games has traditionally been done by rasterization.
      Modern engines have enhanced the basic algorithm with approximations for shadows,
      reflection, indirect light and other features. This leads to complex programs
      with millions of lines of code, which are very expensive to maintain. Until
      recently, an alternative algorithm, ray tracing, had been regarded as too CPU-intensive
      to use in real-time applications like games. Ingo Wald''s research shows that ray
      tracing is possible on normal PCs. This offers fundamental benefits, not only
      for the quality of the generated images, but also to achieve lower production
      costs of games. In this talk we will follow the quest of a game programmer that
      felt challenged by Ingo Wald and decided to jump into the academic world, with
      a promising algorithm that is able to handle even the most powerful systems.</p>

    description: <p><b>Intro</b></p> <p>I'm Puneeth, and I would like to talk about this paper</p> <p><a href="https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/softmine2007/Papers/tichy98.pdf">Should Computer Scientists Experiment More? -- Walter Tichy</a>. I was listening to a wonderful podcast on Ruby Rogues -- What We Actually Know About Software Development and Why We Believe It's True with Greg Wilson and Andreas Stefik -- and there was a very interesting discussion on conducting experimental studies in computer science and basing our development and future work on empirical evidence, instead of guesstimates.  This paper was mentioned in the podcast. It is a quite simple paper, and I picked it for it simplicity, since this is our first meetup and hopefully will lead to a good discussion on the topic.</p> <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p><br/>Computer scientists and practitioners defend their lack of experimentation with a wide range of arguments. Some arguments suggest that experimentation is inappropriate, too difficult,useless, and even harmful. This article discusses several such arguments to illustrate the importance of experimentation for computer science.</p> <p><br/><b>Details<br/></b><br/>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  </p> <p>See <a href="http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/messages/boards/thread/48554457" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/messages/boards/thread/48554457</a> for discussion.</p>

      <p>This paper presents an informal discussion of issues that arise when one
      attempts to analyze algorithms experimentally. It is based on lessons learned
      by the author over the course of more than a decade of experimentation, survey
      paper writing, refereeing, and lively discussions with other experimentalists.
      Although written from the perspective of a theoretical computer scientist, it
      is intended to be of use to researchers from all fields who want to study algorithms
      experimentally. It has two goals: first, to provide a useful guide to new experimentalists
      about how such work can best be performed and written up, and second, to challenge
      current researchers to think about whether their own work might be improved
      from a scientific point of view. With the latter purpose in mind, the author
      hopes that at least a few of his recommendations will be considered controversial.</p>'

      <b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Statistics play an important role in influencing the plans produced by a query optimizer. Traditionally, optimizers use statistics built over base tables and assume independence between attributes while propagating statistical information through the query plan. This approach can introduce large estimation errors, which may result in the optimizer choosing inefficient execution plans. In this paper, we show how to extend a generic optimizer so that it also exploits statistics built on expressions corresponding to intermediate nodes of query plans. We show that in some cases, the quality of the resulting plans is significantly better than when only base-table statistics are available. Unfortunately, even moderately-sized schemas may have too many relevant candidate statistics. We introduce a workload-driven technique to identify a small subset of statistics that can provide significant benefits over just maintaining base-table statistics. Finally, we present experimental results on an implementation of our approach in Microsoft SQL Server 2000.</p>

Hopefully, there will also be some code/demo to show!</p> <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.</p>

    description: '<p>Thanks to Mozilla for hosting!</p> <p>This month''s paper is
      "The Next 700 Programming Languages" by Peter J. Landin. One of the most influential
      papers of all time in PL research!</p> <p><br/>PDF: <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Landin66.pdf"><a

      <p><br/>Abstract:</p> <p><i>A family of unimplemented computing languages is
      described that is intended to span differences of application area by a unified
      framework. This framework dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined names,
      and the conventions about characterizing functional relationships. Within this
      framework the design of a specific language splits into two independent parts.
      One is the choice of written appearances of programs (or more generally, their
      physical representation). The other is the choice of the abstract entities (such
      as numbers, character-strings, list of them, functional relations among them)
      that can be referred to in the language. The system is biased towards “expressions”
      rather than “statements.” It includes a nonprocedural (purely functional) subsystem
      that aims to expand the class of users'' needs that can be met by a single print-instruction,
      without sacrificing the important properties that make conventional right-hand-side
      expressions easy to construct and understand.</i></p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

      What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an
      awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers.
      Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas
      or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Or, just come, listen, and discuss!</p>

    description: <p>History! Those who don't know it are doomed to etc.</p> <p>Smalltalk is one of the earliest object-oriented languages. It's extremely influential — many of the OO concepts that we use in today's languages were first developed in Smalltalk. But what influenced Smalltalk? Alan Kay will walk us through the language's inspirations in this talk, including such crazy new technologies as UIs with overlapping windows and a 1970's-era ur-tablet!</p> <p><a href="http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/" class="linkified">http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/</a></p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Douglas Creager is a software engineer at Google with an eclectic history. He got a CS Master's from MIT working in a biology group, and a PhD from Oxford while teaching formal methods to professional software engineers. He's worked as a consultant helping finance and telecoms firms wrangle data between different systems, and was VP of Engineering for a network security startup based out of DC. He lives deep in the western suburbs, but realizes that “Papers We Love Worcester” doesn't have quite the same ring to it.</p>

    description: '<p>Have you ever wished GUI tools for building visuals like PowerPoint
      and Illustrator had a more programming-like interface for making similar images
      rather than copying, pasting, and tweaking all the time? Have you ever wished
      programmatic systems like LaTeX and Processing.js allowed you to just click
      and drag on items in the output to change the result, rather than going through
      an edit-compile-run cycle every time? In some of the latest research, you can
      have both!</p> <p>In this talk, Jon Schuster will discuss "Programmatic and
      Direct Manipulation, Together at Last" [1] from this year''s PLDI (Conference
      on Programming Language Design and Implementation). The paper proposes a method
      to automatically edit an SVG-generating program to match the changes made by
      dragging components of the resulting image around the canvas, while still allowing
      the developer to edit the code directly. A prototype is available online [2],
      so expect interactive demos!</p> <p>A shorter position paper [3] that discusses
      the overall goal and strategy from a higher-level is also available.</p> <p>Bio:
      Jon Schuster is a PhD student at Northeastern University studying techniques
      for reasoning about programming with actors, as in Erlang and Scala''s Akka
      framework. A former software developer, he hopes to soon return to industry
      and work on bringing brilliant ideas from academia into the real world.</p>

    description: <p><b>An oversimplified history of CSP</b></p> <p>Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) was first described by Tony Hoare in 1978.  Since then, there have been two main "branches" of further development.  In the first branch, CSP inspired how concurrency is handled in an ongoing series of programming languages — most recently (and famously) in Go.  In the second branch, CSP was refined into a rigorous "process calculus", and has since been used to formally prove various safety and liveness properties of concurrent and distributed systems.</p> <p>This talk will be a whirlwind history of CSP, a high-level overview of the process calculus, and some live demos of using a refinement checker to prove things about interesting systems.  (No proving things by hand!)</p> <p>CAR Hoare.  "<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-3472-0_16">Communicating Sequential Processes</a>", CACM 21(8), pp. [masked], 1978.</p> <p>CAR Hoare.  <a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/"><i>Communicating Sequential Processes</i></a>.  Prentice Hall, 1985.</p> <p>AW Roscoe.  <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf"><i>The theory and practice of concurrency</i></a>.  Prentice Hall, 1998.</p> <p>Douglas Creager is a software engineer at Google.  He first learned about CSP as a grad student at Oxford.  In the not-too-distant past, he used CSP to do something <a href="http://dcreager.net/publications/014-csp-algorithm-study/">empirically useful</a>.</p>

    description: <p>"You are not expected to understand this." That is the now famous comment in UNIX v6's process switching (swtch) code. Process switching -- and multitasking more generally -- is a neat magic trick the OS pulls off. It's a delicate dance between the operating system and the hardware. We will dig into how this dance works on UNIX v6 and the PDP11, including the famous comment. We will also look into how the process switching magic happens on a more recent OS and CPU architecture (FreeBSD on x86). It should be a fun trip down the rabbit hole of operating system kernels internals and instruction set specifications</p>

    description: <p>Godel's Incompleteness Theorems are among the most famous results in modern mathematics.  They are often informally stated as follows:</p> <p>1. Any formal system that can express elementary arithmetic contains statements that are "true but not provable".</p> <p>2. Any consistent formal system that can express elementary arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency.</p> <p>These informal statements, however, often raise more questions than they answer.  What exactly is a "formal system"? What does it mean for a statement to be "true but not provable"?  What does it mean to "express arithmetic", and why does arithmetic have anything to do with proof or consistency?</p> <p>This talk will introduce the audience to the main ideas behind the incompleteness theorems.  We'll discuss the historical context in which the incompleteness theorems were discovered, develop the concepts necessary to properly understand what the theorems actually say, and present a sketch of the theorems' proof.</p> <p><br/>References: </p> <p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/" class="linkified">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/</a></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/smorynski.pdf"><a href="http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/smorynski.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/smorynski.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>Bio:</p> <p>Scott Sanderson is a Senior Engineer at Quantopian, where he is responsible for designing and implementing Python APIs for algorithmic trading.

If you'd like to co-organise, moderate or can help in any other way, ping &lt;a&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, he'll add you to admins.</p> <p><b>How does it work? </b></p> <p>We all read papers offline, then we meet together and start up a discussion, hacking, trying things out, bringing up examples from industry and learn more about what we've read.</p> <p>We've got four lightning talks to heat up the discussion:</p> <p>- Sorting algorithms based on 0-1 lemma (Stefan Schwetschke)</p> <p>- RANSAC (random sample consensus) algorithm with a few examples (Kai Wolf)</p> <p>- Software systems that use Paxos or Raft (Daniel Mitterdorfer)</p> <p>- An overview how etcd uses the raft protocol (Christine Koppelt)</p> <p>


      <b>Why should I participate?</b></p> <p>Because papers are fun! It's actually quite easy to read papers, and we'd like to have more people who know about modern Computer Science and Math trends. That would significantly improve your knowledge and marketability.</p> <p>There are many more papers to read and discuss. You can check some of them on <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p>The next Meetup will be about probabilistic data structures, what they are and what they are used for. It is thought more as an overview of the different data structures than of sophisticated use cases.</p> <p>

      The following article provides a good overview about the topic: [1]</p> <p>

      Wikipedia is also a good starting point [2]</p> <p>

      Some (definitely not all) interesting papers are:</p> <p>

      • Bloom filter: Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors [3]</p> <p>

      • Skip list: Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees [4] </p> <p>

      • Count–min sketch: An Improved Data Stream Summary: The Count-Min Sketch and its Applications [5]</p> <p>

      • Hidden Markov Models: [6], [7], [8]</p> <p>


      Agenda:</p> <p>

      19:00 - 19:30 Socializing</p> <p>

      19:30 - 20:30 Talks</p> <p>

      Bloom Filters - Stefan Seelmann</p> <p>

      Count-Min Sketch - Alex Petrov</p> <p>

      Hidden Markov Models - Juan Miguel Cejula</p> <p>


      20:30 - 20:45 Break</p> <p>

      20:45 - 21:30 Discussion</p> <p>

      For the rest of the evening, starting to create something would be nice (for those who don't get enough). Some ideas:</p> <p>

      • Implementing one or multiple data structures in a language of choice</p> <p>

      • Creating browser based animations how some of the data structures work</p> <p>

      • Evaluating existing implementations</p> <p>

      • Outline for a (non-scientific) magazine article or conference talk</p> <p>

      <p>Interested in Probabilistic Programming?</p> <p><br/>Come over &amp; join our next meetup! We're going to talk about Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods. </p> <p>If you'd like to get prepared and know more, you can read the "Bayesian Methods for Hackers" book: <a href="https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers"><a href="https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers" class="linkified">https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers</a></a></p> <p>We'll host two talks. </p> <p>One is by Alex Petrov, he's going to talk about Bayesian Inference and how to make machines biased: </p> <p>Humans have many biases. Let's call them priors. They also have their expertises. Let's call them hypothesis spaces. We often make the conclusions we make swiftly, and without much effort and call it intuition. How do we make machines reason intuitively and what it may end with.  </p> <p>Examples will be given in Probabilistic Programming framework called Anglican, successor of the Goodman &amp; Tenenbaum Church language.</p> <p>


      One will be given by Johannes Drever. He will give some examples from the book <a href="https://probmods.org/">"Probabilistic Models of Cognition"</a> in the church programming language. The paper <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/45/18327.short">"Simulation as an engine of physical scene understanding"</a> serves as an in-depth example on how Monte Carlo simulations may be used as a model of human cognition.</p>

    description: <p>Artificial Intelligence is booming and how! The current trend is to use<b> Deep Learning</b> tools across a multitude of domains. However, there are alternate Machine Learning approaches which can perform robust and accurate reasoning and learning on complex relational data. Today in this talk, I will speak about one such approach of Markov Logic Networks (MLN) in <b>Statistical Relational Learning (SRL)</b>. MLN is a powerful framework combining combining statistical (i.e. Markov Random Fields) and logical reasoning (First Order Logic). I will highlight an example of how it can be used on text to do Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and extract affordances in the Robotics domain. This use case scenario shows how large scale inference on text can be leveraged to give knowledge to artificial assistants. This introductory talk would touch base on the basics and acquaint you with all the state of the art tools. Watch this space for more!</p> <p><b>JetBrains </b>will be hosting this meetup. Location is the Event Space, which you reach from the right side entrance of the building.</p>

    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.

    description: <p>Google Code Jam 2013 contest to solve tough algorithmic puzzles is coming. The registration is on March, 12. <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam" class="linkified">https://code.google.com/codejam</a></p> <p>For free, practice algorithms, have fun and may travel to London and win $15,000*.</p> <p> </p> <p>And I've just got the idea that we can refresh our knowledge of algorithms together.</p> <p><b>Moreover</b>, we are very lucky because Prof. David Wagner of Algorithms and Programming at Hanyang University agreed to give us a brief overview of the algorithms.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have any programming experience, give it a try. The competition is not easy at all but will be a good experience.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Place</b></p> <p>Currently, I plan to do it at my home where there may be place for 6~10 people and we can meet for free. This is a specific topic so I don't expect that more than 10 people will join.</p> <p>But everyone is welcome and can bring friends. If more people join by Friday, we can move to a seminar room of TOZ(<a href="http://www.toz.co.kr/index.htm" class="linkified">http://www.toz.co.kr/index.htm</a>) at Gangnam or Jonggak where only 6,000won/person should be paid for 2 hours (If you are a student, you may not need to pay).</p> <p><b>Activity</b></p> <p>- Listen to tips from Prof. David</p> <p>- Share knowledge of algorithms</p> <p>- Code examples from previous Code Jams</p> <p> </p> <p>P.S. This is the meetup of the nonstandard form.</p> <p>But a common meetup is coming soon in March.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have questions or won't be able to find the place of the meetup, please call to my number[masked]-7394.</p> <p>* If you win the main prize and feel that Prof. David contributed to that achievement, I will suggest to share 10% with him.</p>

      News</a>, you''ve almost certainly seen the "Show HN" or "Ask HN" posts. Well,
      it''s time to get off the Internet and tell us about it face to face. We''ll
      provide you with our honest feedback, you provide us with a great hack, or idea.</p>
      <p>We''ll give you 5 minutes to show off your tool, hack, library (did you just
      write a library to access the Meetup API in Go!?), whatever. We''re language
      and software/hardware agnostic, so it''s all fair game.</p> <p>Your project
      doesn''t have to be a software project. We''re using a very broad definition
      of hacking. Anything customized or personalized counts. Please don''t feel shy.</p>
      <p>After you present, it''s an open forum. The audience will ask questions and
      provide feedback. We want to enable as much participation as possible at these
      meetups, so you''d better be able to take criticism and dish it out (all within
      reason of course).</p> <p> </p>'

We'll provide you with our honest feedback, you provide us with a great hack, or idea.</p> <p>We'll give you 5 minutes to show off your tool, hack, library (did you just write a library to access the Meetup API in Go!?), whatever. We're language and software/hardware agnostic, so it's all fair game.</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/e/6/600_331714022.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>List of speakers:</b></p> <p><br/>• <b>How to fail a Samsung App Challenge </b></p> <p>  Reflects the experience of a team hacking of Galaxy Note to create a productivity app based on convergence of S-Pen, Chord and 2nd-screen SDKs. </p> <p><a href="http://seoultechsociety.org/post/70173415237/seoul-tech-rises-to-samsung-challenge">seoultechsociety.org/post/[masked]/seoul-tech-rises-to-samsung-challenge</a></p> <p> </p> <p>• <b>BigData: Audit Log Manager prototype</b></p> <p>   Taming big data through distributed processing and interactive visualization using hadoop and d3.js</p> <p>

What made this usable was a "Window Manager". It gave you titlebars, the ability to move windows, resize them, virtual desktops, focus management etc. etc. ... At the time I had tried various Window Managers, and not being happy with Any of them I decided to teach myself C as a language, learn X11 and the raw libraries it was based on, and build myself a Window Manager. Now about 19 years later and over 1 million lines of C code still standing (not to mention all the code written, thrown away and replaced), a career now centered around it, It wasn't so hard, but I had no idea what I was getting into.

      <p>Do you want to know what is happening beneath the screen?</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/2/f/2/600_425713042.jpeg" /></p> <p>Let's discover together with Max Goncharov the deep dungeons of underground online economy. Then, we will have a discussion about specifics of Korea.</p> <p><br/>Max Goncharov is a senior security virus analyst at <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/us/index.html">Trend Micro</a> based in Germany; he is visiting Korea to present at the <a href="http://www.powerofcommunity.net/">POC</a> conference.</p> <p>Joshua James has a broad background of collaboration with police of different countries (including Korea) and academic research.</p> <p>Details of their profiles and the event's topics are below.</p> <p>


      Topic 1:</p> <p>40 Min.<br/>“Building the Botnet. How much and how easy…”</p> <p>Online fraud has long since moved from being a mere hobby to a means for cybercriminals to earn a living. Almost every day we can see reports of new cybercrime activity in social networks, blogs and forums, or the part of the easily 'visible' Internet.<br/>There is another side to the Internet however - its criminal underbelly - and here just like on the blogs and forums, communication is key. In this talk we will cover the principles of underground information exchange, ways to secure money/goods in underground transactions and basic cyber hierarchy.<br/>We will also talk about underground products and services. Crypt services, DDoS attacks, Traffic resale, Bulletproof servers, SMS Fraud, Spam services and Credit card Hijacking - these will be covered with pricing comparisons shown over the last 2-3 years. We will go through the typical pricing steps of a criminals attack - from buying software, all the way to monetize the volumes of infected victims.<br/>This presentation will be based on the Max's research paper: <a href="http://gmax.at/101"><a href="http://gmax.at/101" class="linkified">http://gmax.at/101</a></a></p> <p>Topic 2:<br/>40 Min.</p> <p>“APT Targeted attacks use case and cyber underground”</p> <p><br/>We will analyse some of the most popular Russian underground forums where we can see footprints of possible APT announcement. We will discuss attacks with interesting use cases, such as the attack on the Ukrainian Voting system, as well as possible leads to Russian attackers. Next we will take a look RAT tools and how they are available and wildly used for account hacking which can lead to APT.</p> <p>Topic 3:</p> <p>20 Min.</p> <p>"Cybercrime in Korea and what to watch out for"</p> <p>Joshua James and students from <a href="http://www.kitribob.kr/bob/">KITRI's Best of the Best</a> information security program will give a quick discussion about some common cybercrimes that happen in Korea, and how to protect yourselves.</p> <p>

      <p><br/><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/1/0/600_430164592.jpeg"
      /></p> <p>For both web designers and software developers Jim Quanci and Philippe
      Leefsma from Autodesk will show how to make 3D models even more immersive and
      engaging on the Web , and then check out VR on the cheap with Google Cardboard.</p>
      <p><b>AGENDA</b></p> <p>7:00 ~ 8:00 PM: Doors Open. Finger food as you mix and
      mingle.</p> <p>8:00 ~ 8:15 PM: Welcome &amp; Announcements</p> <p>8:15 ~ 8:40
      PM: Presentation by Jim and Philippe - how to deliver immersive and engaging
      3D models through your Web browser</p> <p>8:40 ~8:50 PM: Break</p> <p>8:50 ~9:20
      PM: VR on the cheap with Google Cardboard and the Autodesk Viewing &amp; Data
      web service</p> <p>9:30 PM: Closing</p> <p>WebGL is a very powerful technology
      for enriching the Web with graphics, but how do we get it into the hands of
      the creators? Jim and Philippe will go through some aspects of publishing and
      delivering 3D models on the WEB through a simple easy pipeline, providing coders,
      designers and artists alike with a strong and powerful 3D web graphics tool.
      Not only can you easily bring your 3D models to the WEB, but the Viewer (based
      on three. js) comes with an API which will allow you, your friends and your
      customers to interact with the 3D model and query elements’ metadata.</p> <p>Then,
      Jim and Philippe will demonstrate how WebGL experiences created with the Autodesk
      engine can be elevated to the next level by delivering these 3D models through
      a simple web page to Google Cardboard VR (without your having to invest hours
      of time preparing and publishing your models).</p> <p><br/>For more about Autodesk’s

      <p>SEOUL TECH VER 2.0 + ART EXHIBITION PARTY</p> <p>w/media artist Lee Rahm and sound performer Sunghyun Cho.</p> <p>


      The worlds of art and technology are once again coming together on December 12 at <a href="http://www.kunsthalle.com/seoul">Platoon Kunsthalle</a>. SeoulTech pre-christmas party featuring an art-exhibition by <a href="http://www.leerahm.com/">Lee Rahm</a> and a sound performance by <a href="http://sunghyuncho.com/">Sunghyun Cho</a> offers a perfect opportunity to connect with others who love tech and art. </p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/3/1/600_431717201.jpeg" /></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Exhibition:</b> <b>“Rahm”</b></p> <p>The word “Rahm” represents deep blue, the color of the ocean as extracted from the indigo plant. The same character in its verb form represents the overflowing of energy. In her first solo exhibition Rahm Lee goes beyond defining her medium. You will experience how her works converge and communicate over each others' realms to morph into different forms.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/c/1/600_431716833.jpeg" /></p> <p><br/><b>Rahm Lee</b></p> <p><br/>The works of Rahm Lee span a wide spectrum from video installations to experimental films that embody her theological and socio-critical perspective through metaphors and symbolism. Rahm Lee's first feature film "Virgin Forest"(2012) was invited to screen at the Torino Film Festival and the Edinburgh International Film Festival. Her second feature film " Yongmun"(2013), based on the motif of Korean humor, was presented in the competition category of the Jeonju Film Festival. Several of Rahm Lee's video installation pieces including "숨:결" and "Uprising Falls" is currently on exhibit.She is at present a resident artist at Platoon Kunsthalle.</p> <p><a href="http://www.leerahm.com/"><a href="http://www.leerahm.com/" class="linkified">http://www.leerahm.com/</a></a></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/4/9/600_431694857.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/9/b/600_431694939.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/0/4/600_431695044.jpeg" /></p> <p>


      <b>Sunghyun Cho</b></p> <p>Sunghyun Choʼs performative installations have their origin in the perceptive experience of nature, somewhat resembling the early experiences of an infant exploring his or her surroundings. The recurring themes of his works examine the notions of communication, forms generated from the dynamics of nature, and the relationship between space and sound.</p> <p><a href="http://sunghyuncho.com/"><a href="http://sunghyuncho.com" class="linkified">http://sunghyuncho.com</a></a> </p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/f/9/600_431694777.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/f/e/600_431694782.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/0/2/600_431694786.jpeg" /></p>

    description: '<p><b>What is Launch Lab?</b></p> <p><br/>As part of the <a href="http://seoultech.github.io/stream/">Stream</a> knowledge
      implementation program, SeoulTech is proud to announce the Launch Lab kick off
      event. Scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, designers, and any tech enthusiast
      interested in innovation can discuss and propose projects, as well as solicit
      ideas and help from other SeoulTech members.</p> <p>Projects represent early-stage
      ideas in order to get feedback from the audience and recruit new members to
      further develop ideas during the up-coming six month Stream program. There will
      be six presentations total, but this is not a competition. The goal is to share
      ideas and to learn from each other.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/e/2/600_432872994.jpeg"
      /></p> <p><b>Why?</b></p> <p><br/>This program allows members  to get involved
      with the creation of new ideas or startups, while forging friendships and business
      partnerships to last a lifetime. </p> <p>We are very excited about technology
      and its potential in the near future, and we want to focus our energy into developing
      projects that have real-life impact. We hope to help people start projects that
      can solve relevant issues in Infrastructure, Security, Energy, the Environment,
      and other areas that have actual real-world relevance. The projects do not necessarily
      have to take the form of venture-funded startups. Launch lab is not limited
      only to entrepreneurs, but also open-source projects, non-profit organizations,
      and all other forms of group, club or organization with an idea for development.
      Of course, we will also help teams develop relationships with investors if a
      project has potential as a high-growth startup.</p> <p><br/><b>How? </b></p>
      <p>Apply via the Meetup RSVP. We will pre-select 6 ideas for presentations (10
      to 15 minutes), and if anyone gets inspired during the event, we will also have
      an ''open mic'' session for more ideas from any attendee. If you don’t get selected,
      don’t worry. There will be plenty of time for you to network with others and
      get feedback during the session. Remember, this is about creating a community,
      not about competition.</p> <p>If you have an idea but don’t want to present,
      bring it with you anyway. There will be plenty of time for you to discuss and
      share with others.</p> <p>If you are curious about joining a team or just want
      to listen and learn, then please come along. We will do our best to make sure
      everybody gets a chance to participate</p> <p><b>When?</b></p> <p><br/><i>Jan

      <p>Emily's "civic hacking story from San Francisco to Seoul" will share her experiences working on a civic tech project in San Francisco, how it changed her life and helped bring her to Korea.</p> <p>


      This is a collaborative event with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/code-for-seoul/">Code for Seoul</a>, a civic hacking community which tries to make our community and city better by coding.</p> <p>

      <img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/2/6/600_433144646.jpeg" /></p> <p>

      <b>Story</b>:</p> <p>Emily's researching is on Korean tech, focusing specifically on the sharing economy as a strategy for urban sustainable development.  During the first half of her grant year, she focused on learning broadly about the Korean start up ecosystem, which is just starting to emerge from the shadows of the large Chaebols.  The challenges facing start ups in Korea are immense, given that the start-up mentality is the opposite of traditional Korean business culture; however, there are many unique opportunities for tech start ups in Korea as well, a future-thinking culture with incredible tech infrastructure and hardware manufacturing expertise.  Nonetheless it may take a generational shift to fully realize this potential.  <br/>In the next stage of her research, she hopes to conduct a case study of AirBnB hosts in Yeonnam-dong, Seoul  to examine the social, environmental, and economic benefits of the sharing economy. </p> <p>Before coming to Korea, she worked on projects related to Internet law at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, and in the Mayor's Office in San Francisco.</p> <p>more in her talk...</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b>:</p> <p>


      <a href="http://emilyhong.com/"><a href="http://emilyhong.com/" class="linkified">http://emilyhong.com/</a></a>         <a href="https://twitter.com/emilme">@emilme</a></p> <p>

      A recent graduate of Yale and current Fulbright scholar in South Korea researching the sharing economy, she hopes to build a career at the intersection of policy, law, and technology. This interest was ignited during a summer fellowship at the San Francisco Mayor’s Office in 2013. Working with the Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation (MOCI) (and Code for America, the Open Gov Foundation, and Github), she helped start the SF Open Law Initiative to increase public access to legislative documents by making them available as open data.</p> <p>

      <b>Agenda</b>:</p> <p>7:30 - gate open<br/>7:45 - intro about Code for Seoul and SeoulTech<br/>7:50 - what is civic hacking?<br/>8:00 - Emily's story<br/>8:45 - civic hacking projects' ideas &amp; demos<br/>9:30 - after-party and socializing</p> <p><br/>We'll move to a bar nearby to have some beer, a good time and mix&amp;mingle among seoultechies and code for seoul hackers.</p>

      <p>Hey game aficionados! This one is for you.</p> <p>

      Seoul Tech Society,  Minch&amp;Films and Korean Film Archive are glad to invite you to the screening of “State of play”, a documentary about Korean professional gamers. Director Steven Dhoedt will attend the screening and do a Q&amp;A session afterwards.</p> <p>e-스포츠와 게임팬 여러분들께 기쁜 소식을 전합니다!</p> <p>


      민치앤필름과 서울 테크 소사이어티는 여러분을 장편 다큐멘터리 영화 "스테이트 오브 플레이"의 시사회로 초대합니다. "스테이트 오브 플레이"는 최초 벨기에-한국 공동제작 장편 다큐멘터리 영화로, 한국의 프로게이머들의 삶과 도전을 다루는 작품입니다. 영화 상영후에는 감독 스티븐 두트가 시사회에 함께하여 관객 여러분들과의 질의응답 시간을 가질 예정입니다.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/9/e/600_433391934.jpeg" /></p> <p>

      <b>STATE OF PLAY </b></p> <p>

      <i>"Man only plays when in the full meaning of the word he is a man, and he is only completely a man when he plays."</i></p> <p>

      <i>— Friedrich Schiller</i></p> <p>

      A feature documentary about the world of South-Korean professional gamers.</p> <p>

      Every year thousands of South-Koreans flock to the game stadiums in Seoul to watch the Pro League, a live sports event where professional gamers compete to be the best at one single video game: Starcraft.</p> <p>

      It’s a title many young South Koreans dream of. The game itself is more than a decade old, almost ancient in the fast developing world of video games, but in South Korea it has become a national past-time. Like most specator sports, this world of eSports rapidly evolved in a multi-million dollar business.</p> <p>

      In this story, we follow 3 boys in different stages of their career as a Pro-Gamer in South Korea. For some it will be a struggle to stay on top of their game, for others it might be the turning point of their lives.</p> <p>

    description: <p>What can be cooler and more futuristic than robots!? But this future is already coming and sooner than expected robots will be around us flying in skies,  serving at our houses or enhancing our bodies. </p> <p>Don't miss the chance to learn when the era of robots is coming and what technologies enable it.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/d/b/600_435074555.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>Prof. Lenskiy:</p> <p>• What is <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>, how it is changing Robotics</p> <p>• Flaws of CS education</p> <p>• How we introduce robotics to improve CS education</p> <p>Dr. Stonier:</p> <p>• Where are we with Robotics?</p> <p>• Who is doing what?</p> <p>• ROS/OSRF and the international Robotics Community</p> <p>• Why is it so challenging?</p> <p>• Some Stories</p> <p>        • Working on a Robotics Team</p> <p>        • Working on a Robotics Product</p> <p>• Do you have what it takes?</p> <p>• Forging a new robotics business</p> <p>Dr. Popov:</p> <p>- What is exoskeleton and what are the possible applications?</p> <p>- Why don’t we see them on streets yet?</p> <p>- How to make a life-fissile robotic system?</p> <p>- Exoskeleton start-up</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p><i>Artem Lenskiy</i></p> <p>Artem Lenskiy is a professor at Korea University of Technology and Education (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk_3NsLDXhI"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk_3NsLDXhI" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk_3NsLDXhI</a></a> univ promo video where he took part). He has broad range of interests including programming in different languages and data analysis applied in cryptocurrency and digital healthcare systems. One of his passion is research of robotics which he will share with SeoulTech.</p> <p><i>Daniel Stonier</i></p> <p>Daniel Stonier gets to work [play] with robots. All day. Every day. Something that most techie folk dream about or madly try to squeeze into their hobby time at the risk of raising the ire of their partners. He also gets to work with the international robotics community where you can find some of the most exciting and passionate young people on technologies that are quite literally walking out of movies into our lives. It’s not an easy career, and it is a long way from the farm he grew up on and the mathematics he studied and taught at university, but it’s never dull!</p> <p><i>Dmitry Popov</i></p> <p>Dmitry Popov is a researcher who has been working on bringing robotics into daily life by developing an exoskeleton for a daily assistance and rehabilitation. The ideas of building a robot that can enhance the abilities of a normal person will probably give you some excited feelings. Dmitry has been working with such robotics systems for the past 5 years, trying to make them actually feasible for a daily life.<br/>It takes some patience and creativity to make a device that can be worn on your body, providing an extra power or speed, and will not disturb your natural motions or limit your casual activities. So far he has been successful in making several versions of upper limb soft exoskeleton. He has also big plans for commercialization.</p>

    description: '<p>If you follow the media, you might be under impression that Seoul
      is the new Silicon Valley and startup ecosystem is blossoming here. In reality,
      however, the majority of people are stuck in large enterprises, and don’t even
      know where to begin when it comes to setting up a company.</p> <p>That is why
      we invited <i>Hongseok Choe</i> from <a href="http://global.seoul.go.kr">Seoul
      Global Center</a> to cover the basics of setting up a company in Seoul with
      specialties such as: obtaining the visa,  getting funding and entering the market.</p>
      <p>To put the local startup ecosystem into a perspective, we invited speakers
      from <a href="https://twitter.com/sgsmu">Singapore Management University</a>
      to cover the entrepreneurial opportunities in Singapore, a country famous for
      its mature startup ecosystem.</p> <p>On <i>Thursday, April 30</i> let’s find
      out together whether Singapore or Seoul these days have more opportunities for
      starting your own technology company.</p> <p><br/><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>Hongseok
      Choe — <i>Seoul Global Center</i></p> <p><i><b>“</b>How to start a business
      in Seoul as a foreigner”</i></p> <p>Hongseok is the go to man when it comes
      to setting up a company in Seoul as a foreigner. He knows ins and outs of the
      process of starting a company, from obtaining the visa to getting funding and
      entering the market.</p> <p>Junghee Kee — <i>SMBA</i></p> <p><b>“The Korean
      policy for establishing a technology start-up ecosystem and the programs that
      support foreigners”</b></p> <p>Junghee works for SMBA as a main person in charge
      of global startup program. As an official, she is also engaged in various governmental
      startup programs. She is one of the most knowledgeable people in Korean startup
      ecosystem.</p> <p><br/>Zu Cheng and Tat Loong — <i>Singapore Management University</i></p>
      <p><i><b>“Technopreneurship in Singapore”</b></i></p> <p>Zu Cheng and Tat Loong
      will give an introduction to Singaporean startup scene. They would be looking
      at the history, the factors, the current climate of entrepreneurship (specifically
      in technology) and the future for budding entrepreneurs in Singapore.  </p>'

      <p>En esta ocasión tenemos la suerte de contar con Alberto Cortés, que nos hablará de sus experiencias sobre Diff/Blame y cómo están construyendo su propia versión en Go</p> <p>Diff es una algoritmo venerable, desarrollado en 1970 para Unix; básicamente es una distancia de Levenshtein, pero orientado a líneas en vez de a carácter. Git-blame utiliza diff de una forma bastante interesante para detectar qué commit fue el último en modificar cada línea de un fichero.</p> <p><br/>Durante la charla se revisarán como funcionan ambos algoritmos, diff y blame, de una forma intuitiva y Alberto nos hablará de los papers y recursos que ha utilizado para llevar a cabo su desarrollo.</p> <p>Referencias de algunos de los papers utilizados:</p> <p><a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf">Myers, 1986, "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations"</a> </p> <p><br/><a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ejw/papers/MSR26s-zimmermann.pdf">Zimmerman, 2006, "Mining Version Archives for Co-changed Lines"</a></p> <p>

    description: <p>We will talk about the paper "Path, Trees and Flowers" by Jack Edmonds.</p> <p>This paper is seminal in graph theory. It describes the maximum matchings blossom algorithm, which finds a decomposition of a graph in the maximum number of pairs connected by an edge.</p> <p>It is also the base of the famous minimum weight maximum matchings algorithm, a very important algorithm used in many applications, from pairing in chess tournaments to resources or worker placement within companies.</p>

    description: '<p>The main problem when automatically analysing source code is
      finding a meaningful representation that captures the specific properties of
      programming languages. While there are widely adopted techniques for building
      “word embeddings” for natural language (like Word2vec), these are not applicable
      to source code, whose syntax and vocabulary are simpler .</p> <p>This paper
      presents a model for learning “code embeddings”, relying on the syntactic structure
      of the code, expressed as Abstract Syntax Trees, and how to use those embeddings
      for code classification tasks.</p> <p>Paper is available here: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3358"

    description: <p>We're really glad to have Christopher Meiklejohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/cmeik)"><a href="https://twitter.com/cmeik" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/cmeik</a>)</a> with us.</p> <p><br/>Chris will be talking about <b>HyParView:  a membership protocol for reliable gossip-based broadcast</b></p> <p><i>Gossip, or epidemic, protocols have emerged as a powerful strategy to implement highly scalable and resilient reliable broadcast primitives. Due to scalability reasons, each participant in a gossip protocol maintains a partial view of the system. The reliability of the gossip protocol depends upon some critical properties of these views, such as degree distribution and clustering coefficient.Several algorithms have been proposed to maintain partial views for gossip protocols. In this paper, we show that under a high number of faults, these algorithms take a long time to restore the desirable view properties. To address this problem, we present HyParView, a new membership protocol to support gossip-based broadcast that ensures high levels of reliability even in the presence of high rates of node failure. The HyParView protocol is based on a novel approach that relies in the use of two distinct partial views, which are maintained with different goals by different strategies.</i></p> <p><br/>You can read the full paper here: <a href="http://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/dsn07-leitao.pdf"><a href="http://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/dsn07-leitao.pdf" class="linkified">http://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/dsn07-leitao.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Are you gonna miss it?</p>

    description: <p>Causality is an essential component of how we make sense of the physical world, and of our relations to other humans. If I put a cup on the table, and look back at it, I expect it to be there. I also expect to get a reply to my postcards, after I send them, and not before.  </p> <p>These days hardly any service can claim not to have some form of distributed algorithm at its core. In a distributed scenario, if we are not careful, it is very easy to break the causal sense of things. In a key-value store my writes can be directed to a replica, and my subsequent reads served from an outdated one --- my cup might not be there when I look back. Message dissemination middleware might not always provide the ordering I expect --- I might receive some replies, before their leading questions. </p> <p>Luckily, most of these problems were already there 30 years ago, although in a much smaller scale, and lots of techniques have been developed to keep track of causality and make sense of the complex interactions in modern systems. However developers often look at techniques such as as replica synchronization with version vectors, or causal broadcasting algorithms, as black boxes; or as complex sets of rules that have to be followed and not questioned. </p> <p>This talk will focus on bringing back the intuition on causality, and show that keeping in mind some simple concepts, allows to understand how version vectors and vector clocks work, and were they differ, and how to use more sophisticated mechanisms to handle millions of concurrent clients in modern distributed data stores. </p>

    description: <p>Patricia G. Selinger, Morton M. Astrahan, Donald D. Chamberlin, Raymond A. Lorie, Thomas G. Price. [Access path selection in a relational database management system. SIGMOD, 1979.](<a href="https://t.co/KsfkS4evlM" class="linkified">https://t.co/KsfkS4evlM</a>)</p> <p>Databases are one of the backbones of our applications, we use them daily but  probably we didn't stop to analyze how things works under the hood. We take  for granted that given some declarative query (i.e with SQL), the RDBMS will try to be as efficient as possible. This enables data-independent query processing,  back in the day with systems like [IMS](<a href="https://t.co/jm3sxobbup" class="linkified">https://t.co/jm3sxobbup</a>)  queries were done using low level information, so knowledge about the underlying data structures was needed to be able to perform efficient queries. The presented paper is the foundation for query optimization field, it decomposes the problem into three distinct subproblems:</p> <p>- Cost estimation<br/>- Relational equivalences<br/>- Cost-based search</p> <p>We'll explore how solving those sub-problems databases are able to calculate "good-enough" query plans.</p>

    description: '<p>Do a web search for "Out of the Tar Pit," and you''ll find 1)
      <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf?raw=true">the
      paper itself</a> and 2) a long list of "top 10 papers every programmer should
      read" type blog posts citing it. The premise of the paper is certainly ambitious:
      Explain why developing and maintaining large software systems is hard, and how
      to fix it. </p> <p>Amazingly, this 10 year old paper mostly delivers. Perhaps
      even more surprisingly, however, its clear explanation, high citation count,
      and relatively straightforward prescription for dealing with complexity have
      not translated into a correspondingly large influence on mainstream programming
      tools and frameworks (with certain notable exceptions, such as the Clojure community). </p>
      <p>In a sense, then, reading the paper informs us not only of the authors''
      strategy for building large, maintainable systems, but of our own community''s
      ability to digest useful but wide-reaching suggestions for change. We are sure
      to have a lively discussion! </p> <p>It''s not necessary to read the entire
      paper to attend the meetup, but it is a great and accessible paper and you''ll
      probably enjoy it if you do. The presentation should be accessible to and useful
      people who have read the entire paper multiple times and people who have just
      skimmed the abstract. </p> <p>This meeting is sponsored by Improving Enterprises,
      who will provide food and drinks. </p> <p>About the presenter: Mykola Bilokonsky

      <p>Online tax preparation or financial advice sounds like a viable business, but "secure" sites are broken every day. Consumers are rightly wary of disclosing their personal information to cloud-based service providers. How can you build a service which delivers real value and is backed by a hard, cryptographic guarantee of security?</p> <p>

      What if it were possible for a customer to give their data to a cloud provider in encrypted form, and for that provider to perform useful computations on that data without ever decrypting it? The results would be delivered to the customer, encrypted with a key that only they knew. It sounds like an ideal solution, but maybe impossible?</p> <p>

      This is the promise of homomorphic encryption. The idea has been around for some time, but it was considered intriguing but maybe not possible until Craig Gentry's groundbreaking thesis. Gentry later published a much more accessible paper called "Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data".</p> <p>

      <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf" class="linkified">https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf</a></p> <p>

      Research on homomorphic encryption is fast-moving, and the state of the art is improving every year. The presenter's opinion is that homomorphic encryption will change cloud computing in a way similar to how SSL/TLS changed online commerce. It is the future of online privacy.</p> <p>This event is presented in cooperation with Franklin University's Computer Science program. They'd appreciate an RSVP at <a href="http://whoozin.com/7G7-WRQ-YPP6"><a href="http://whoozin.com/7G7-WRQ-YPP6" class="linkified">http://whoozin.com/7G7-WRQ-YPP6</a></a> for space planning purposes.</p> <p>About the presenter: </p> <p>Craig Stuntz is a software engineer and a lifelong student of computer science, with specific interests in programming languages, type theory, compilers, and math. He lives in Columbus, Ohio, works for Improving Enterprises as Principal Consultant II, and cofounded the Columbus branch of Papers We Love, a reading group for people interested in academic computer science research.</p> <p>When not at work or playing with his kids, he is usually studying math or playing Irish traditional music on the tin whistle and wooden flute.</p>

    description: <p>The Downtown Developers Book Club and Papers We Love Columbus are both reading groups for people interested in computer science, and somehow I ended up with the logins for both of them, so I'm merging the two so that I only have one group to administer. </p> <p>I'd like to do an evening meetup later this year about a computer science research paper, as is usual for PWL, so don't fear we're going soft on you. :)</p> <p>The book club has selected <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms">Grokking Algorithms</a>, by Aditya Y. Bhargava, as our next title, and it's a good one!</p> <p>Please consider joining us for lunch downtown and interesting conversation. See you there!</p>

    <p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss. </p>
    <p>We're curating a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a> for papers and places-to-find papers. You can contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories. </p>
    <p>We're posting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove">videos</a> of all our presentations, from all our chapters. If you need to reach out to us or have ideas for papers, just ask us via <a href="https://twitter.com/PapersWeLoveCMH">our twitter account</a>. </p>
    <p><span>Papers We Love has a <b><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a></b>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is now following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!</span><br>

      <p>I'm going to talk about shape grammars (split grammars, place grammars), in particular their application to procedural 3D content generation as presented in the paper "Procedural Modeling of Buildings" by Müller, Wonka, et al.  This was a landmark paper (along with the 2003 "Instant Architecture") that is still the state of the art in some ways.  There might be some digression into general grammar-driven generation, especially for automatic test generation, since it's a broad and interesting topic.</p> <p>



      The primary paper I'll be discussing is available at</p> <p><a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf">  <a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf" class="linkified">http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf</a></a></p> <p>The author's site,</p> <p>  <a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/publications.html"><a href="http://peterwonka.net/Publications/publications.html" class="linkified">http://peterwonka.net/Publications/publications.html</a></a></p> <p>is a great resource for papers related specifically to building and facade modelling, including a paper, "On-the-fly Generation and Rendering of Infinite Cities on the GPU", which refers to the paper Peter Zion presented last month on dynamic GPU memory allocation.  Of special interest, too, is Inverse Procedural Modeling, on which much work has been done in the last few years and which builds upon the use of shape grammars.</p> <p><br/>I also considered presenting Stiny's original paper, which is available along with a bibliography of more general shape grammar papers (some of which I'll be mentioning) at</p> <p>  <a href="http://shapegrammar.org/"><a href="http://shapegrammar.org/" class="linkified">http://shapegrammar.org/</a></a></p> <p>



      Finally, for some motivating examples, here is a 64k demo (i.e., the program which produces this output is only 64 kilobytes, and does it in realtime!) that has some characteristic shape grammar effects:</p> <p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZdlSWLqumw"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZdlSWLqumw" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZdlSWLqumw</a></a></p> <p>And here are some examples from someone's work-in-progress game involving procedurally-generated sprawl:</p> <p>  <a href="http://delacian.tumblr.com/"><a href="http://delacian.tumblr.com/" class="linkified">http://delacian.tumblr.com/</a></a></p>

      <p>Pablo Duboue will present "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/zero.pdf">Structural Zeros versus Sampling Zeros</a>" by Mohri and Roark; this looks like a fascinating paper with applicability to improving all kinds of probabilistic models.  He will also be talking about the specific application of this idea to probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parsing as discussed in another Mohri and Roark paper, "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/spcfg.pdf">Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar Induction Based on Structural Zeros</a>".  Anyone interested in machine learning, natural language processing, parsing in general, even automated test generation and model checking, or all kinds of other topics should definitely attend!</p> <p>



      I apologize for the delay in announcing this meetup.  I was in Toronto checking out their PWL chapter to hopefully borrow some ideas (and speakers!) and lost track of time.</p> <p>


      Note that since Radialpoint have kindly offered to host again, and their building closes early, we're going to try to start this meetup at 6:30, by which I mean you should come sometime around 6:00 to enjoy a libation and conversation before the talk starts at 6:30.  (Times subject to change, of course; be sure to check the meetup page on the day of the event.)</p>

      <p>Peter Zion will present two great papers on deep learning; first, Yann LeCun’s seminal 1998 paper, "<a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf">Gradiant-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition</a>", which will give some background and context for Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton's 2012 paper, "<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a>", in which (to quote Peter), "they [...] create a GPU-based DNN that is better at image recognition than any human".</p> <p>


      Given the length of the first paper, I recommend reading Krizhevsky's paper in detail, and skimming LeCun's paper as needed for background.</p> <p>


      Everyone interested in machine learning, image processing and recognition, or GPU computing should come!</p> <p>


      This event is part of <a href="http://mtldata.com/bdw">Big Data Week</a>.  Be sure to check out the rest of the schedule!</p> <p>


      Finally, a huge thanks to the folks at Radialpoint for hosting us again.</p>

Java JITs, JavaScript JITs, etc. It's still very relevant to JIT compiler design, but it's something you may not learn about in a compiler class. The technique was pioneered in Self, but I thought this paper is best, because the Self paper introducing it also introduces a half-dozen other optimizations, which would just confuse the discussion."</p> <p>I am very excited about having an interesting compiler paper presented at PWLMTL, and I'm sure all you compiler design afficionados will enjoy this one.  For those who don't think they're interested in compilers, consider how insight into JIT optimizations can help you reason about the performance of all that JavaScript, JVM, and .NET code you interact with all the time!</p> <p>If you have had any trouble getting to the meetups in the past, please let me know if there is something I can do to make it easier.  Also, we will try to have food this time as I know that was popular at some of the past meetups.</p>

      <p>David Rowley will present Claude Shannon's<a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Shannon%20-%20A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication.pdf"> "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"</a> (later renamed<i> The</i> Mathematical Theory of Communication once its importance was recognized).  This is a pretty hefty paper (anywhere between 49 and 55 pages depending on the printing), but so foundational in our field.  David says:</p> <p>  <i>My big interest is the discovery process by which Claude Shannon managed to "synthétiser / put it all together coherently and sequentially." Shannon took a lot of what was known in tidbits here and there and put it into a "one paper is all you need to read" kind of document. </i></p> <p>I think that's a good reason to love this paper in particular.  I hope that in the discussion we can hear all your perspectives on how Shannon's work continues to directly affect our work and many other areas.</p> <p><br/>I'll have some comments on this in relation to my own recent work with succinct data structures, and it would be nice to hear, not just about compression and entropy which are the areas I think of when I think of this paper, but maybe even queuing theory, distributed systems, and other places this work touches.</p> <p>


      There will be pizza and beer so you can think out loud on a full stomach.  (Suggestions for alternative refreshments or any other aspect of the event's organization are always welcome.)</p>

      <p>I'm a huge fan of Daniel Lemire's work on compressed bitmaps, sorted sequences of integers, and other data structures.  I'd say half the papers I have on my desk at work right now have his name on them.  I've invited him to speak at PWLMTL on his own work, rather than on a paper he loved, because <b>I</b> love his papers: I find them to be practical and accessible to the working developer in a way that few academic works manage to be.</p> <p><br/>He's going to speak about compressed bitmaps, in particular the Roaring bitmap approach he first published <a href="http://r-libre.teluq.ca/602/1/RoaringBitmap.pdf">in this paper</a> (cited below).</p> <p><br/>The bitmap, especially in compressed form, is a very versatile data structure despite its apparent simplicity, and I invite all developers to consider it for many purposes.</p> <p>Just recently, I used compressed bitmaps in an application which needed to represent large sets of IP addresses efficiently.  In the last few years, I've used them in the implementation of a database system, an IMAP server, and a pubsub messaging system.  (Not to mention their ubiquity, uncompressed, in allocators of all sorts.)</p> <p>AdGear will be hosting us again for this meetup, and beer and pizza will be provided; feel free to come around 6 to eat and chat before the talk!</p> <p>

      An abstract for the talk follows:</p> <p>


      <b> Better bitmap performance with Roaring bitmaps</b></p> <p><br/>Bitmaps are used to implement fast set operations in software. They are frequently found in databases and search engines.</p> <p>Without compression, bitmaps scale poorly, so they are often compressed. Many bitmap compression techniques have been proposed, almost all relying primarily on run-length encoding (RLE). For example, Oracle relies on BBC bitmap compression while the version control system Git and Apache Hive rely on EWAH compression.</p> <p>We can get superior performance with a hybrid compression technique that uses both uncompressed bitmaps and packed arrays inside a two-level tree. An instance of this technique, Roaring, has been adopted by several production platforms (e.g., Apache Lucene/Solr/Elastic, Apache Spark, eBay's Apache Kylin and Metamarkets' Druid).</p> <p>Overall, our implementation of Roaring can be several times faster (up to two orders of magnitude) than the implementations of traditional RLE-based alternatives (WAH, Concise, EWAH) while compressing better. We review the design choices and optimizations that make these good results possible.</p> <p>One interesting feature of this work is that it has been out in the open from the start. Roaring bitmaps is the result of a far ranging collaborative effort. We believed that it played a role in its success.</p> <p>If time allows, ongoing and future development efforts will be discussed.</p> <p>

      I'll end with a tantalizing quote from Veach's thesis, the section "Why Light Transport is Important":</p> <p><i>  One of the main goals of light transport algorithms is to increase human efficiency in the modeling of realistic virtual environments.  [...]  The main problem is that the algorithms used for production work ... do not have the ability to simulate indirect lighting.  [...] If we could find robust light transport algorithms, then the indirect lighting could be computed automatically, which would make the lighting task far easier.</i></p> <p><i>  Another important application of light transport is predictive modeling, where we wish to predict the appearance of objects before they are built.  This idea has obvious uses in architecture and product design.  [...]</i></p> <p><i>  Finally, better techniques for light transport in graphics may lead to better methods in physics and engineering, because light transport has a structure that is similar to radiation and particle transport problems.</i></p>

      <p>Jordi Gutiérrez Hermoso has kindly offered to present Brys, Hubert, and Struyf's <a href="https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/papers/2004/medcouple.pdf">A robust measure of skewness</a>, also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medcouple">medcouple</a>, with a focus on the algorithm for its computation.</p> <p>If you can, it's worth tracking down the cited article by Johnson and Mizoguchi that describes a selection algorithm used in the medcouple algorithm.  Unfortunately it does not appear to be freely available on the web.  However, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medcouple#Fast_algorithm">wikipedia article for the medcouple</a> has an excellent exposition which includes a good description of Johnson + Mizoguchi, which is elided from the paper.</p> <p>


      Jordi has provided the following description for the talk:</p> <p><br/><i>Identifying outliers is a delicate but common statistical problem. One of the most basic definitions of an outlier is given by familiar box and whisker plots, as defined by Tukey: an outlier is anything outside of the boxplot's whiskers. A problem with this simple definition is that it tends to give too many outliers for data that is very heavily skewed towards one side or the other.</p> <p>A convenient, non-parametric way to handle skew data is the so-called adjusted boxplot, as defined by Hubert and Vandervieren [1], which adjusts the whisker lengths of the box plot according to the skewness of the distribution. This adjustment requires a nonparametric measurement of skewness that is robust to outliers. The statistic that Hubert and Vandervieren recommend is the medcouple, introduced by Brys, Hubert, and Struyf [2].</p> <p>While the medcouple has many interesting statistical properties, it comes with a price: a naïve medcouple algorithm for a sample of size n is in the O(n^2) complexity class. Using Johnson and Mizoguchi's method for finding the median of a matrix with sorted rows and sorted columns [3], we can improve upon the naïve algorithm with a fast O(n log n) medcouple algorithm.</p> <p>This talk will briefly touch upon these three papers and how they work together as a method for defining outliers for skew distributions. The presentation should appeal to those with a knowledge of basic statistics. The discussion of finding the median of a sorted matrix is interesting in its own right to anyone who cares about classical problems in computer science.</p> <p>---</p> <p>[1] M. Hubert; E.

    description: <p>Raimi Rufai will present <a href="http://www.cccg.ca/proceedings/2015/50.pdf">A Streaming Algorithm for the Convex Hull</a>.  Although this is his own work, it is an elegant algorithm with a clean, concise paper.</p> <p>Unfortunately I haven't gotten the chance to finish my own implementation of it, but I invite everyone to read the paper, as it's short, and I expect the discussion tonight will be very interesting.  Whether you're already a big fan of computational geometry, or you're wondering "what is a convex hull?", or you're wondering "is there any use for a convex hull outside graphics?", you should come to this one.</p>

      This should be a good follow-up to Jeff's talk on Metropolis Light Transport.  Those interested in graphics, physics, or probabilistic methods should certainly attend!  I'm sure there will be interesting implementation details, too.</p> <p>


      If you aren't sure where to start with these papers, try sections 4 (Insight and Overview) and 7 (Random Walk on the Microsurface) of the first paper.</p>

      <p>I will present <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nahum/w6998/papers/sosp87-timing-wheels.pdf">Hashed and Hierarchical Timing Wheels</a> by Varghese and Lauck.  This is the basis for pretty much every operating system's timer facility, and has an important role in distributed systems.  (As usual, <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/11/23/hashed-and-hierarchical-timing-wheels/">Adrian Colyer's writeup of this paper</a> is great; see also <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/11/24/gd-wheel/">the subsequent discussion of GD-Wheels</a>.)</p> <p><br/>I'll talk about some specific implementations of this idea, in <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint/erts/emulator/beam/time.c">Erlang's runtime system</a>, in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/time/timer.c">Linux</a> (see also <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/646950/">this lwn article</a>), as well as Juho Snellman's <a href="https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-07-27-ratas-hierarchical-timer-wheel/">Ratas</a> and possibly some others.  (The article on &lt;a&gt;Kafka's use of timing wheels&lt;/a&gt; is easy to understand.)</p> <p>

      The front door for AdGear's new office is not finished, so please enter via the alleyway behind the building (rue de Longueuil between Notre-Dame and Saint-Maurice), per the map.  There will be a sign on the door.</p>

    description: <p>Rupert Brooks will present "<a href="http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/unser9502.pdf">Convolution-Based Interpolation for Fast, High-Quality Rotation of Images</a>", by Unser et al.  This paper considers a long line of methods for performing image rotation by factoring the rotation into two or more 1D transformations, and addresses the question of how to perform those 1D translations in the highest quality way.</p> <p>While several authors have proposed these types of decompositions for image rotation, the paper by Paeth (<a href="http://www.cipprs.org/papers/VI/VI1986/pp077-081-Paeth-1986.pdf">A Fast Algorithm for General Raster Rotation</a>) is one of the most commonly applied.  (Also revised and updated as article III.6 in the original Graphics Gems.)  It may be helpful to read that paper in preparation for this one.</p> <p>The presentation will include digging into some open source packages to see what they actually do.</p>
