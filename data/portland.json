This framework dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined names, and the conventions about characterizing functional relationships. Within this framework the design of a specific language splits into two independent parts. One is the choice of written appearances of programs (or more generally, their physical representation). The other is the choice of the abstract entities (such as numbers, character-strings, list of them, functional relations among them) that can be referred to in the language. The system is biased towards “expressions” rather than “statements.” It includes a nonprocedural (purely functional) subsystem that aims to expand the class of users' needs that can be met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificing the important properties that make conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.</i></p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>What was the last paper you read and loved within the realm of computing?

We will mainly look at the compression algorithms making this possible.</p> <p>Here is the abstract:</p> <p>\n\n\n\"\"\"</p> <p>Large-scale internet services aim to remain highly available and responsive in the presence of unexpected failures. Pro-viding this service often requires monitoring and analyzing tens of millions of measurements per second across a large number of systems, and one particularly effective solution is to store and query such measurements in a time series database (TSDB).</p> <p>A key challenge in the design of TSDBs is how to strike the right balance between efficiency, scalability, and relia-bility. In this paper we introduce Gorilla, Facebook’s in-memory TSDB. Our insight is that users of monitoring sys-tems do not place much emphasis on individual data points but rather on aggregate analysis, and recent data points are of much higher value than older points to quickly detect and diagnose the root cause of an ongoing problem. Gorilla op-timizes for remaining highly available for writes and reads, even in the face of failures, at the expense of possibly drop-ping small amounts of data on the write path. To improve query efficiency, we aggressively leverage compression tech-niques such as delta-of-delta timestamps and XOR’d floating point values to reduce Gorilla’s storage footprint by 10x. This allows us to store Gorilla’s data in memory, reduc-ing query latency by 73x and improving query throughput by 14x when compared to a traditional database (HBase)-backed time series data. This performance improvement has unlocked new monitoring and debugging tools, such as time series correlation search and more dense visualization tools. Gorilla also gracefully handles failures from a single-node to entire regions with little to no operational overhead.</p> <p><br/>\"\"\"</p> <p>\n\n\nPDF: <a href=\"http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/portland/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md\">Reminder: Papers We Love PDX has a code of conduct.</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":0.0,"address1":"1120 NW Couch St #320","address2":null,"name":"Mozilla PDX","postalCode":"","lon":0.0,"country":"us","city":"Portland"},"utcOffset":-25200000,"time":1496278800000,"title":"Gorilla: A Fast, Scalable, In-Memory Time Series Database"},"234072402":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-PDX/events/234072402/","description":"<p>Thanks to Airbnb for hosting!</p> <p>This month's paper is \"Top 10 algorithms in data mining\" by Wu et al. and will be presented by Lisa Orr.</p> <p>PDF: </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algorithms/10Algorithms-08.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algorithms/10Algorithms-08.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algorithms/10Algorithms-08.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>------------------------------------------</p> <p>What was the last paper you read and loved within the realm of computing?
