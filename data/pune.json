What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.</i></p> <p><b>If you have read a paper and found it really interesting and want share your thoughts on it - welcome!</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/33-hints/WebPage.html\">Hints for Computer System Design</a>, Presented by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neeran\">Neeran</a></p> <p><br/>Does this sound fun? </p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":18.553110122680664,"address1":"402A, Town Square, Airport Road, Viman Nagar","address2":"Landmark: Above Dorabjee's, on the 4th Floor","name":"Doo","postalCode":null,"lon":73.88111114501953,"country":"in","city":"Pune"},"utcOffset":19800000,"time":1402115400000,"title":"Paper's we love #1"},"221831694":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Doo-Things/events/221831694/","description":"<p>This is a one day camp for kids 8+ where they will be introduced to basics of robotics. 1 Led Blinking<br/>2 Switch based movements for (pupet/rovers)<br/>3 Automating the pupet/rovers<br/>4 Hands on arduino.<br/>5 Advanced rover workshop.</p> <p>For registration click <a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/rituparna89/summer-robotics-camp-1/\">here</a></p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":18.553110122680664,"address1":"402A, Town Square, Airport Road, Viman Nagar","address2":"Landmark: Above Dorabjee's, on the 4th Floor","name":"Doo","postalCode":null,"lon":73.88111114501953,"country":"in","city":"Pune"},"utcOffset":19800000,"time":1429950600000,"title":"Kids Summer Robotics Camp"},"234588135":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Doo-Things/events/234588135/","description":"<p><b>Arduino Kids - Level 1 (Getting Started) (Paid Event)</b></p> <p><b>From Users to Makers</b></p> <p><i>Introduce kids to exciting world of Physical Programming with Arduino and enable them to create their own gadgets, smart machines and robots.</i></p> <p><b>Why Programming?</b></p> <p>·  It helps developing logic</p> <p>·  Develops computational thinking</p> <p>·  Enhance creativity</p> <p><b>Why Arduino?</b></p> <p>·  Physical actions in real world excite kids</p> <p>·  Make interactive objects for their school projects</p> <p>·  Learn basics of electronics and robotics</p> <p><b>What kids will learn?</b></p> <p>·  Introduction of “real” programming language</p> <p>·  Familiarization with the Arduino and IOT</p> <p>·  Making software interact with real world</p> <p><b>What would I need?</b></p> <p>·  Arduino kit and other required hardware will be provided</p> <p>·  You would need to bring a laptop along with you.</p> <p><b>Is my kid ready?</b></p> <p>·  There is no minimum age if the kid is computer savvy (which most kids are).</p> <p>·  We recommend this for age group of 10+.</p> <p><b>Who is the Trainer?</b></p> <p>I am programmer &amp; software architect with 17+ years of experience.
