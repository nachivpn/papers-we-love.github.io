It's got everything in there: People over Process, No Single Process, even a preference for knowledge in developer's heads over \"knowledge\" represented in documentation &amp; manuals.</p> <p>I'll be recapping the paper briefly and discuss what a \"Theory of a Program\" is. I'll then move onto talking about the parallels between Naur's Theories and Kuhn's (whom Naur invokes in the paper) notion of Paradigm in traditional science. I'll end by discussing how this paper influenced the Agile movement (Alistair Cockburn in particular) and why it's still massively relevant today.<b></p> <p>About Peter Naur: </b>Peter Naur was a Danish computer science pioneer and Turing award winner. His last name is the \"N\" in the BNF notation (Backus-Naur form), used in the description of the syntax for most programming languages. He contributed to the creation of the ALGOL 60 programming language (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur\">from Wikipedia</a>).</p> <p>\n\n• <i>A Categorical Theory of Patches</i> by <a href=\"http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/\">Samuel Mimram</a> and <a href=\"http://www.i3s.unice.fr/digiusto/\">Cinzia Di Giusto</a><br/>Presented by Hunter Madison, CustomInk</p> <p><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903\">homepage</a> | <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.3903v1\">pdf</a></p> <p><b>Summary: </b>For most of us, version control is an integral part of our professional workflow. It's difficult to imagine working on large teams or long-term projects without the ability to branch or merge! But how does it actually work?</p> <p>This paper takes a look \"under the hood\" of version control–its aim is to provide a formal mathematical definition of patches using category theory. It starts with the basic case of two users who make non-conflicting changes on the same file, goes over increasingly complex examples, and finally explores the general case.</p> <p><br/><b>Note:</b> In contrast to the first paper, this paper is heavy on mathematical terminology and notation. The introduction provides a good summary, and I suggest keeping your browser open to look up unfamiliar terms.

Jeub, et al.<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Porter_M/0/1/0/all/0/1\"></p> <p></a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05185.pdf\">pdf</a> | <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05185\">site</a><br/><i><br/></i><b>Abstract: </b>The analysis of multilayer networks is among the most active areas of network science, and there are now several methods to detect dense \"communities\" of nodes in multilayer networks. One way to define a community is as a set of nodes that trap a diffusion-like dynamical process (usually a random walk) for a long time. In this view, communities are sets of nodes that create bottlenecks to the spreading of a dynamical process on a network. We analyze the local behavior of different random walks on multiplex networks (which are multilayer networks in which different layers correspond to different types of edges) and show that they have very different bottlenecks that hence correspond to rather different notions of what it means for a set of nodes to be a good community. This has direct implications for the behavior of community-detection methods that are based on these random walks.</p> <p><b>About Mandi:</b> Mandi is a Senior Data Scientist at <a href=\"https://cybraics.com/\">Cybraics</a>; in the community, she is the co-Founder of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WomenDataSci/\">Women Data Scientists DC</a> and President of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DataCommunityDC/\">Data Community DC</a>.

The concept is then applied to external disk or distributed storage to obtain an algorithm that achieves single access searches, close to single access inserts and greater than 80 percent disk block load factors. Comparisons are made with Linear Hashing, Litwin, Neimat, and Schneider [1993] and B-Trees, R.Bayer and E.M.McCreight [1972]. In addition two further applications of AMTs are briefly described, namely, Class/Selector dispatch tables and IP Routing tables. Each of the algorithms has a performance and space usage that is comparable to contemporary implementations but simpler.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":38.872459411621094,"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":"","lon":-77.22986602783203,"country":"us","city":"Fairfax"},"utcOffset":-18000000,"time":1519862400000,"title":"Ideal Hash Trees"},"bpckxlyzdbkc":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-DC-NoVA/events/bpckxlyzdbkc/","description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.\"</p> <p><b>About Dr. Hadley Wickham:</b> Hadley Wickham is a statistician from New Zealand who is currently Chief Scientist at RStudio and an adjunct Assistant Professor of statistics at Rice University.

However, they struggle with combinatorial tasks that can be solved faster if many operations are performed in parallel. Here, we present proof-of-concept of a parallel computer by solving the specific instance {2, 5, 9} of a classical nondeterministic-polynomial-time complete (“NP-complete”) problem, the subset sum problem. The computer consists of a specifically designed, nanostructured network explored by a large number of molecular-motor-driven, protein filaments. This system is highly energy efficient, thus avoiding the heating issues limiting electronic computers. We discuss the technical advances necessary to solve larger combinatorial problems than existing computation devices, potentially leading to a new way to tackle difficult mathematical problems.</p> <p><b>About Sam: </b>Sam DeLuca is a software engineer at <a href=\"https://www.cloudlock.com/\">CloudLock</a>, a cloud security company based in Massachusetts, where he works on task scheduling and messaging infrastructure.

Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.\"</p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/2/b/600_463953323.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/3/4/d/600_463953613.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":38.872459411621094,"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":"","lon":-77.22986602783203,"country":"us","city":"Fairfax"},"utcOffset":-14400000,"time":1503529200000,"title":"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"},"ntdzqnyxhbfc":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-DC-NoVA/events/ntdzqnyxhbfc/","description":"<p>Welcome to the DC/NoVA Papers We Love meetup!</p> <p>Papers We Love is an international organization centered around the appreciation of computer science research papers.

Where CNNs are specialized for patterns important in image classification, LSTMs are specialized to exploit structure in multivariate time series, and to overcome a well-known problem in training deep nets, the \"vanishing gradients\" problem. Prep time pending, hopefully we (and I!) will learn a little more Keras/Theano/Tensorflow, too, and be able to look at another example of actually training an LSTM net!</p> <p>For anyone interested in digging into the code we'll likely use a bit more, here's a free Keras blog-torial on building an LSTM: <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/\" class=\"linkified\">https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/</a> . Most likely I'll start there and build an example we can look together on an Amazon Web Service ec2 node with the Amazon machine \"Image Deep Learning AMI (Amazon Linux) Version 1.0 - ami-895adef3\" and the p2.xlarge \"GPU compute\" instance type setting (so a GPU will be available; cost for this sort of node is about $0.90 / hour if you want to do the same on your own).

We'll briefly review what artificial neural networks are broadly, what convolutional neural nets are specifically, and then we'll dig a bit into the mathematical guts of Dieleman et al's models in order to understand how they encode rotation invariance directly into neural-net architectures. We'll then discuss the empirical evidence Dieleman et al share on their neural nets' performance, the advantages and disadvantages of their procedure, and possible generalizations to their approach before opening conversation up to freely meander. We may also take a brief look at some actual examples of coding, computing with, and training rotationally invariant neural nets, if prep time allows.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":38.872459411621094,"address1":"2910 District Avenue ","address2":null,"name":"CustomInk ","postalCode":"","lon":-77.22986602783203,"country":"us","city":"Fairfax"},"utcOffset":-18000000,"time":1512604800000,"title":"Rotational Invariance in Convolutional Neural Networks"}}
