More than a few understand the current state of the art: dotted version vectors and bounded version vectors. Paradoxically, almost everyone missed some of the more subtle concepts, and questions that Lamport introduced in this paper.</p> <p>In the intervening years. Progress has occurred, and the state of the art has evolved. This talk is therefore in three parts. The first being a review of the paper itself, the concepts it introduced, and the assumptions behind these concepts. The second part reflects what we’ve learned in the intervening years, and especially the relationship of Lamport’s (original) understanding of time, which was superior to almost all other computer scientists at the time, and what (in contrast) we know now. The third part will be entirely devoted to questions and answers: Where anyone can ask a question, and anyone can try to answer it. The speaker will try to answer the question if no one else wants to, or if the audience appears dissatisfied. The discussion is expected to be lively, insightful, and potentially, mind blowing.</p> <p>In order to prepare yourself for this talk. Anticipate there will come a point where you are asked to take a blue pill vs. a red pill.  If you watch these videos, your red pill transition will be gentler.  Most of you may prefer to take the blue pill and go back to your old way of thinking about time. In which case, you won’t find this talk very interesting, because of course you already know all the answers.</p> <p>Those who want to be more prepared for the red/blue pill experience, will benefit from both reading the paper, and watching the most recent PBS videos on the nature of spacetime:</p> <p>1.

Rather than being a discussion of one particular paper, the talk is intended as a guided tour of the development of various widely implemented relational database join algorithms, with a particular focus on the pressures that shaped their development. Framing the discussion this way is not intended as a history lesson, so much as a vehicle for explaining the practical relevance of each algorithm under discussion, possible future developments, and the fundamental nature of how relational databases implement joins.</p> <p>That being said, the talk is essentially an exploration of the paper \"Query Evaluation Techniques for Large Databases\", by Goetz Graefe.</p> <p>The talk will make quite a few small detours, generally influenced by related papers, but without veering too far from Graefe's central arguments.</p> <p>Familiarity with working with systems like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle will give a good grounding for understanding the material in the talk. Reading over and working through the \"Using EXPLAIN\" [1] section of the PostgreSQL documentation may be a useful refresher on the topics the talks considers.</p> <p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/using-explain.html\"><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/using-explain.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/using-explain.html</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Peter's Bio </b><br/><a href=\"https://twitter.com/petervgeoghegan\">Peter</a> has been involved in PostgreSQL development since 2011 as both a reviewer and feature implementer, and is a PostgreSQL Major Contributor.</p> <p>His development projects tend to be centered on improving PostgreSQL's performance in various ways, including adding support for group commit, as well as a succession of improvements to the PostgreSQL sort code down through the years.

While on the surface it's all about how to make operating systems scale, it's also a story about how the same researchers can tackle a problem from different angles, succeed each time, and yet end up with very different conclusions. </p> <p>At OSDI '08 Silas Boyd-Swicker et al published <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/boyd-wickizer/boyd_wickizer.pdf\">Corey: An Operating system for Many Cores</a>, which advocated for a fundamental restructuring of the operating system; they observed that scalability problems often manifest because of data unintentionally shared between CPUs, so their research OS provided improved abstractions for programmers to inform the kernel about what is supposed to be local to a particular core or thread.</p> <p>At the subsequent OSDI, though, the same research lab published <a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/linux:osdi10.pdf\">an analysis of Linux scalability to many cores</a>, where they present the same problem -- kernel scalability-- but instead tackled it by finding individual bottlenecks and implementing tiny point fixes, mostly-hidden from application code.  This inverted approach worked so well that in their abstract they arguably recanted the conclusion from their earlier work: \"...there is no scalability reason to give up on traditional OS organizations yet.\"</p> <p>These papers, together, are interesting to me for a bunch of reasons.  The former advocates for better application control of data sharing by exposing new abstraction primitives, whereas the OS remains in the latter paper an opaque layer where we're to be mostly content at not having to look underneath the hood.  Seeing two seemingly opposing philosophies work equally well was a surprising result to me.  It's also interesting how the tacit assumptions we make can cause wildly different systems to be built.  In one, it's treated as axiomatic that a new software architecture is needed, whereas in the other the very first sentence questions the \"traditional architectures don't scale\" assumption.  And, of course, when so many people build careers out of asserting that There's Only One Way To Solve This Problem, it's refreshing to see the same group of researchers try different approaches in such quick succession.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Nathan's Bio</b></p> <p>Nathan is currently working on low-latency content distribution at <a href=\"http://www.fastly.com/\">Fastly</a> and has previously hacked on improving the performance of language runtimes and OS hypervisors.

But, what's the reason for so many systems choosing alternative techniques such as quorum-based or state machine replication? In this talk, we talk through a history of chain replication, starting with the original work from 2004 by van Renesse and Schneider. We will look at the various systems built using chain replication: Hibari, FAWN-KV, and CRAQ. We'll explore safer designs of chain replication, such as the elastic replication work in 2013, and finally look a new and unique designs of chain replication, such as Basho's Machi system. </p> <p><br/>The papers discussed in Chris's talk are:</p> <p>• Object Storage on CRAQ - <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf\"><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• FAWN: A Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes - <a href=\"http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/andersen-sosp09.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/andersen-sosp09.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.sigops.org/sosp/sosp09/papers/andersen-sosp09.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• Chain Replication in Theory and in Practice - <a href=\"http://www.snookles.com/scott/publications/erlang2010-slf.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.snookles.com/scott/publications/erlang2010-slf.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.snookles.com/scott/publications/erlang2010-slf.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• HyperDex: A Distributed, Searchable Key-Value Store - <a href=\"http://hyperdex.org/papers/hyperdex.pdf\"><a href=\"http://hyperdex.org/papers/hyperdex.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://hyperdex.org/papers/hyperdex.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• ChainReaction: a Causal+ ConsistentDatastore based on Chain Replication - <a href=\"http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Almeida.pdf\"><a href=\"http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Almeida.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Almeida.pdf</a></a></p> <p><br/>• Leveraging Sharding in the Design ofScalable Replication Protocols - <a href=\"http://www.ymsir.com/papers/sharding-socc.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.ymsir.com/papers/sharding-socc.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ymsir.com/papers/sharding-socc.pdf</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Chris's Bio</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cmeik\">Christopher Meiklejohn</a> is a Senior Software Engineer with Machine Zone, Inc. working on distributed systems.

This article is an amuse-bouche sampling the repeated patterns of computing that leverage immutability. Climbing up and down the compute stack really does yield a sense of déjà vu all over again.</p> <p><br/>It wasn’t that long ago that computation was expensive, disk storage was expensive, DRAM (dynamic random access memory) was expensive, but coordination with latches was cheap. Now all these have changed using cheap computation (with many-core), cheap commodity disks, and cheap DRAM and SSDs (solid-state drives), while coordination with latches has become harder because latch latency loses lots of instruction opportunities.  Keeping immutable copies of lots of data is now affordable, and one payoff is reduced coordination challenges.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Pat's Bio</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pathelland\">Pat Helland</a> has been working in distributed systems, databases, transaction processing, scalable systems, and fault tolerance since 1978. For most of the 1980s, Pat worked at Tandem Computers as the Chief Architect for TMF (Transaction Monitoring Facility), the transaction and recovery engine under NonStop SQL. After 3+ years designing a Cache Coherent Non-Uniform Memory Multiprocessor for HaL Computers (a subsidiary of Fujitsu), Pat moved to the Seattle area to work at Microsoft in 1994. There he was the architect for Microsoft Transaction Server, Distributed Transaction Coordinator, and a high performance messaging system called SQL Service Broker, which ships with SQL Server. From[masked], he was at Amazon working on the product catalog and other distributed systems projects including contributing to the original design for Dynamo. After returning to Microsoft in 2007, Pat worked on a number of projects including Cosmos, the scalable “Big Data” plumbing behind Bing. While working on Cosmos, Pat architected both a project to integrate database techniques into the massively parallel computations as well as a very high-throughput event processing engine. Since early 2012, Pat has worked at Salesforce.com in San Francisco. He is focusing on multi-tenanted database systems, scalable reliable infrastructure for storage, and software defined networking.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":37.775272369384766,"address1":"135 Bluxome St","address2":null,"name":"OpenDNS","postalCode":"","lon":-122.398681640625,"country":"us","city":"San Francisco"},"utcOffset":-28800000,"time":1487903400000,"title":"Pat Helland on \"Immutability Changes Everything\""},"227849450":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-too/events/227849450/","description":"<p><b>Mini</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://marios.io\">Marios Assiotis</a> on \"Throttling Utilities in the IBM DB2 Universal Database Server\" (<a href=\"http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/prost/proceedings/acc04/Papers/0354_ThA01.3.pdf\"><a href=\"http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/prost/proceedings/acc04/Papers/0354_ThA01.3.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/prost/proceedings/acc04/Papers/0354_ThA01.3.pdf</a></a>)</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Marios' Bio</b></p> <p>Marios is the CTO at TubiTV, the world's largest free streaming TV &amp; movie library.

The construction uses the wreath product, a coordinate system with unidirectional data flow among the factors, like addition with carry. How many group factors are needed? We don't know if this complexity question is decidable, after a half century of work. However, the effort has led to deep insights into regular languages, pseudovarieties (equational specifications of finite algebras), categories, and circuits.</p> <p>Recent work on distributed systems connects eventual consistency with monotonic operations. A special case of K-R shows that such operations are exactly what you can build from semilattices (commutative, idempotent semigroups, which are weaker than flip-flops) using wreath products.</p> <p><br/>[1] K.
