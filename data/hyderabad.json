The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.</p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/f/600_440702623.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/4/0/600_440702624.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":17.416250228881836,"address1":"Plot No.A-32, Film Nagar, Jubilee Hills ","address2":"2nd Floor, Above Jubilee Hills Mercantile Cooperative Urban Bank Limited","name":"Collab.House","postalCode":null,"lon":78.41474914550781,"country":"in","city":"Hyderabad"},"utcOffset":19800000,"time":1439028000000,"title":"Puneeth: ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"},"hqbddlytdblb":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/events/219756952/","description":"<p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/members/13890168/\">Uday</a> will be presenting the paper <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/papers/experguide.pdf\">A Theoretician’s Guide to theExperimental Analysis of Algorithms</a>. The paper presents an informal discussion of issues in analyzing algorithms experimentally, with the goal of providing a useful guide to new experimentalists, and challenging current researchers to improve their work from a scientific point of view.</p> <p>We hope that you'll read <a href=\"http://davidsjohnson.net/papers/experguide.pdf\">the paper</a> before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  </p> <p><br/><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>This paper presents an informal discussion of issues that arise when one attempts to analyze algorithms experimentally. It is based on lessons learned by the author over the course of more than a decade of experimentation, survey paper writing, refereeing, and lively discussions with other experimentalists. Although written from the perspective of a theoretical computer scientist, it is intended to be of use to researchers from all fields who want to study algorithms experimentally. It has two goals: first, to provide a useful guide to new experimentalists about how such work can best be performed and written up, and second, to challenge current researchers to think about whether their own work might be improved from a scientific point of view. With the latter purpose in mind, the author hopes that at least a few of his recommendations will be considered controversial.</p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/5/f/600_434298271.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/5/e/600_434298270.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/6/0/600_434298272.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":17.399999618530273,"address1":"Jubilee Hills Mercantile Cooperative Urban Bank Limited, Plot No.A-.32, Beside Vijaya Bank","address2":"3rd Floor","name":"Collab.House","postalCode":null,"lon":78.4800033569336,"country":"in","city":"Hyderabad"},"utcOffset":19800000,"time":1423908000000,"title":"A Theoretician's Guide to the Experimental Analysis of Algorithms"},"220541532":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/events/220541532/","description":"<p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p>Nithin Movva will be presenting the paper \"Exploiting Statistics on Query Expressions for Optimization\". </p> <p>We hope that you'll read <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/74106/sits.pdf\">the paper</a> before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  </p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Abstract</b></p> <p>Statistics play an important role in influencing the plans produced by a query optimizer. Traditionally, optimizers use statistics built over base tables and assume independence between attributes while propagating statistical information through the query plan. This approach can introduce large estimation errors, which may result in the optimizer choosing inefficient execution plans. In this paper, we show how to extend a generic optimizer so that it also exploits statistics built on expressions corresponding to intermediate nodes of query plans. We show that in some cases, the quality of the resulting plans is significantly better than when only base-table statistics are available. Unfortunately, even moderately-sized schemas may have too many relevant candidate statistics. We introduce a workload-driven technique to identify a small subset of statistics that can provide significant benefits over just maintaining base-table statistics. Finally, we present experimental results on an implementation of our approach in Microsoft SQL Server 2000.</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":17.399999618530273,"address1":"Jubilee Hills Mercantile Cooperative Urban Bank Limited, Plot No.A-.32, Beside Vijaya Bank","address2":"3rd Floor","name":"Collab.House","postalCode":null,"lon":78.4800033569336,"country":"in","city":"Hyderabad"},"utcOffset":19800000,"time":1425808800000,"title":"Nithin Movva: Exploiting Statistics on Query Expressions for Optimization"},"223575311":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/events/223575311/","description":"<p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p>Hrishikesh Barua is going to speak about Software Defined Networking discussing what it is, discuss the history of the technology and demo a Python SDN controller. </p> <p>We hope that you'll read <a href=\"https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2560327\">the paper</a> before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  </p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/1/e/600_439669694.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/1/f/600_439669695.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/2/0/600_439669696.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":17.399999618530273,"address1":"Jubilee Hills Mercantile Cooperative Urban Bank Limited, Plot No.A-.32, Beside Vijaya Bank","address2":"3rd Floor","name":"Collab.House","postalCode":null,"lon":78.4800033569336,"country":"in","city":"Hyderabad"},"utcOffset":19800000,"time":1436695200000,"title":"Hrishikesh Barua: The Road to Software Defined Networking"},"224524700":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-hyderabad/events/224524700/","description":"<p>Driver-less cars is the next big thing in transportation systems using which we can reduce lot of accidents and also we can optimize travelling time.
