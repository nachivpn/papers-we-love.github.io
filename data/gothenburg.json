He is the recipient of a Google Research Awards and several grants from the Swedish research agencies Vetenskapsrådet, STINT, and Barbro Osher foundation. Internationally, Prof. Russo worked on prestigious research institutions like Stanford University, where he was appointed visiting associate professor. His research ranges from foundational aspects of security to developing tools to secure software written in Haskell, Python, and JavaScript. ( <a href=\"http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/</a> ).</p> <p>The paper presents a monadic API in Haskell which takes advantage of the type system to protect confidentiality of data. Since the API utilizes the type system of Haskell, it guarantees confidentially of data during compile time itself! It is very interesting to see how the information flow in the system is restricted even in the presence of computation with side-effects.

They will be providing some food and drinks too! ;)</p> <p>Below, you can find the abstract for the talk and the speaker's bio.</p> <p>--------------------</p> <p><b>Algebraic effects</b></p> <p>Algebraic Effects offer a simple and uniform interface to program effects. They are very expressive: they can capture patterns usually hard-wired into programming languages, such as exceptions, generators (yield), asynchronicity (async and await). Further, they offer a principled approach to impurity: state, heap effects and IO. In comparison to monads they compose in the sense that they can be run in any order (without quadratic encodings such mtl's), and the run functions are easier to implement. </p> <p>Algebraic Effects were introduced by Plotkin and Power in 2003, and Algebraic Effect Handlers by Plotkin and Pretnar in 2009 and have gained in popularity and implementations in the recent years, in dedicated languages such as Eff, Links, Frank and Koka, and in libraries for Haskell and Idris. The paper we will give some love this meeting is Daan Leijen's \"Type directed compilation of row-typed algebraic effects\" from POPL 2017. This article gives an excellent introduction to algebraic effects from a programmer's perspective. It describes his language Koka and shows how to effectively compile it into JavaScript.</p> <p>--------------------</p> <p><b>About Speaker<br/></b></p> <p>Bio: Dan Rosén has a MSc in CS and Licentiate Degree from Chalmers about theorem proving for functional programs. He is a systems developer at Språkbanken, University of Gothenburg, mainly doing ML and front-end development. In his spare time he cannot stop himself searching for better programming languages.</p> ","photos":[{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/2/4/600_465088708.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/2/9/600_465088713.jpeg","height":null,"width":null},{"url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/2/a/600_465088714.jpeg","height":null,"width":null}],"venue":{"lat":57.70538330078125,"address1":"Drakegatan 7","address2":null,"name":"TimeEdit AB","postalCode":null,"lon":11.99404239654541,"country":"se","city":"Göteborg"},"utcOffset":7200000,"time":1507219200000,"title":"Dan Rosén on \"Algebraic Effects\" at TimeEdit"},"235666159":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Gothenburg/events/235666159/","description":"<p>We'll be discussing \"Propositions as Types\" by Philip Wadler on our first meetup. <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Gothenburg/members/91963582/\">Víctor</a> will be presenting the paper to us.</p> <p>You can download the paper here: <a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/plt/propositions-as-types.pdf?raw=true\"><a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/plt/propositions-as-types.pdf?raw=true\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/plt/propositions-as-types.pdf?raw=true</a></a></p> <p>---------</p> <p><b>[UPDATE]</b> At the event:</p> <p>• You will be able to access WiFi on request.

The speaker presents the paper, and the presentation is followed by a discussion where we discuss the ideas in the paper, it's practical implications, related research, future work etc., You can show off some implementation or your thoughts on the paper. The event will be quite informal (you suit up at your own risk!) and can go on for about 1-2 hours.</p> <p>Wait, but why the **** ?!</p> <p>Because it's fun to read papers and talk about it. The speaker walks us through the paper and it's background, helps us understand the math and demystify the technical jargon. You learn a lot and also get different perspectives. Overall, its a great opportunity to know about different areas of research in computer science.</p> <p>Should I attend?</p> <p>Of course! The members are a blend of engineers, hackers, researchers and students. Irrespective of your background, you are welcome to attend and indulge in the science.</p> <p>Can I help?</p> <p>Was hoping you'd ask this one. Papers We Love is community driven, so you are welcome to start a discussion, present a paper, help organize or host a meetup. Currently, we are in *need* of a co-organizer to help us out.
