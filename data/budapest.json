The details surrounding rebalancing are usually just too messy. To show that this need not be the case, we present an algorithm for insertion into red-black trees (Guibas &amp; Sedgewick, 1978) that any competent programmer should be able to implement in fifteen minutes or less.</i></p> <p><br/>You can find it here:</p> <p><br/><b>Okasaki, C.

No prior knowledge of monads or category theory is required. </i></p> <p><i>Monads increase the ease with which programs may be modified. They can mimic the effect of impure features such as exceptions, state, and continuations; and also provide effects not easily achieved with such features. The types of a program reflect which effects occur. </i></p> <p><i>The first section is an extended example of the use of monads. A simple interpreter is modified to support various extra features: error messages, state, output, and non-deterministic choice. The second section describes the relation between monads and continuation-passing style. The third section sketches how monads are used in a compiler for Haskell that is written in Haskell.\"</i></p> <p>I hope that after this, we will hold regular meetups, so if you feel that you a paper that is close to your heart, please contact me, and we'll arrange a time for your talk also.</p> <p><br/>If you have questions or suggestions please contact me also, I'm open to all suggestions!</p> <p>Regards, </p> <p>Daniel</p> ","photos":[],"venue":{"lat":47.500118255615234,"address1":"1061 Paulay Ede u. 12., Ground floor","address2":null,"name":"LogMeIn Collab Space","postalCode":null,"lon":19.05691909790039,"country":"hu","city":"Budapest"},"utcOffset":3600000,"time":1488478500000,"title":"BP-HUG/PWL - The essence of functional programming"},"242791943":{"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Budapest/events/242791943/","description":"<p><b>Gergő will be presenting Brown &amp; Palsberg's paper from POPL 2017: \"Typed Self-Evaluation via Intensional Type Functions\"</b></p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p><i>We can easily make a typed representation for STLC in Haskell, and then write an evaluator over that representation.
