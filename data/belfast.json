For our first PWL Belfast event of 2017 sponsored by HighWire Press, we're very happy to have Phil Weir presenting a talk titled <a href=\"https://maths.ucd.ie/~plynch/Publications/WPNP-Foreword.pdf\">20 May 1910: LF Richardson and the Dawn of Simulation</a>.</p> <p><br/>Summary</p> <p>Accurate weather forecasts based on computer simulation are now produced as a routine, and have reached such a level of reliability that the rare forecast failures evoke a strong reaction in the media and amongst users. Numerical simulation of an ever-increasing range of geophysical phenomena is adding enormously to our understanding of complex processes in the Earth system. The consequences for mankind of ongoing climate change will be far-reaching. Earth System Models are capable of replicating climate regimes of past millennia and are the best means we have of predicting the future of our climate. </p> <p><br/>Details</p> <p>Doors open at 6.30 pm and the presentation will begin at 7 pm. There will be food (please drop the organisers a message if you have dietary requirements), beers and lemonade!</p> <p>After Phil presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.

We'll also have a short presentation from Paddy Carey reporting back from his time at PWLConf in St. Louis!</p> <p><i>A Literal Program</i></p> <p>Last month‘s column introduced Don Knuth’s style of “Literate Programming” and his WEB system for building programs that are works of literature. This column presents a literate program by Knuth (its origins are sketched in last month‘s column) and, as befits literature, a review. So without further ado, here is Knuth’s program, retypeset in Communications style. </p> <p><br/><i>A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems<br/></i></p> <p>An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: 1. Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. 2. A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. </p> <p><br/><i>Details</i></p> <p>Doors open at 6.30 pm and the presentation will begin at 7 pm.

This time, we're delighted to welcome Michael Jason Smith presenting a Research at Google paper, &lt;a&gt;Idle Time Garbage Collection Scheduling&lt;/a&gt;!</p> <p><br/><i>Abstract</i></p> <p>Efficient garbage collection is increasingly important in today’s managed language runtime systems that demand low latency, low memory consumption, and high throughput. Garbage collection may pause the application for many milliseconds to identify live memory, free unused memory, and compact fragmented regions of memory, even when employing concurrent garbage collection. In animation-based applications that require 60 frames per second, these pause times may be observable, degrading user experience. This paper introduces idle time garbage collection scheduling to increase the responsiveness of applications by hiding expensive garbage collection operations inside of small, otherwise unused idle portions of the application’s execution, resulting in smoother animations. </p> <p>\n\n<i>Details</i></p> <p>Doors open at 6.30 pm and the presentation will begin at 7 pm.

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.</p> <p><br/>Details</p> <p>Doors open at 6.30 pm and the presentation will begin at 7 pm.
