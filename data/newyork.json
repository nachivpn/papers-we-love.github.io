We're all familiar with routing problems, such as the recent <a href=\"http://news.rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-annotated\">RapGenius incident</a>. It turns out that simple improvements to randomized routing can dramatically improve the performance! Sparrow is a distributed scheduling algorithm for low latency, high throughput workloads. We'll review the Sparrow algorithm, and learn the tricks that they used. Then, we'll discuss other applications of Sparrow, besides the big-data map-reduce application it was created for. </p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>David Greenberg loves learning. He currently works at Two Sigma, where he leads several efforts to build reliable, distributed cluster computing environments. He enjoys reading a good paper with glass of scotch on a cold winter night.

Using an auxiliary memory of <i>m</i> units (typically, \"<i>short bytes</i>\"), <i>HyperLogLog</i> performs a single pass over the data and produces an estimate of the cardinality such that the relative accuracy (the <i>standard error</i>) is typically about 1.04/√m. This improves on the best previously known cardinality estimator, <i>LogLog</i>, whose accuracy can be matched by consuming only 64% of the original memory. For instance, the new algorithm makes it possible to estimate cardinalities well beyond <i>10^9</i> with a typical accuracy of 2% while using a memory of only 1.5 kilobytes.

What we take for granted and what we question? And how do theories in computer science tell us something about the real world? Those are some of the questions that may inspire computer scientist like me (and you!) to look into philosophy of science. I’ll present the work of one of the more extreme (and interesting!) philosophers of science, Paul Feyerabend. In “Against Method”, Feyerabend looks at the history of science and finds that there is no fixed scientific methodology and the only methodology that can encompass the rich history is ‘anything goes’. We see (not only computer) science as a perfect methodology for building correct knowledge, but is this really the case? To quote Feyerabend: </p> <p><i><b>Science is much more 'sloppy' and 'irrational' than its methodological image.</b></i></p> <p>I’ll be mostly talking about Paul Feyerabend’s “Against Method”, but as a computer scientist myself, I’ll insert a number of examples based on my experience with theoretical programming language research.

It is a paper that describes the real tradeoffs that real systems engineers make when designing something to solve a large set of problems well enough. This paper shows the key insights that the authors had as to how such a system might be used, and awareness of what it should do well, and what it should not try to do well.

It's a heralded paper that has a super interesting <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04695.pdf\">follow-up</a> (<i>On the Complexity and Performance of Parsing with Derivatives</i>), <a href=\"http://swannodette.github.io/2016/06/03/tools-for-thought\">has influenced </a><a href=\"http://clojure.org/about/spec\">clojure.spec</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzsK8Am6dKU\">this helpful video</a>!</p> <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We present a functional approach to parsing unrestricted context-free grammars based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brzozowski_derivative\">Brzozowski's derivative of regular expressions</a>. If we consider context-free grammars as recursive regular expressions, Brzozowski's equational theory extends without modification to context-free grammars (and it generalizes to parser combinators). The supporting actors in this story are three concepts familiar to functional programmers - laziness, memoization and fixed points; these allow Brzozowski's original equations to be transliterated into purely functional code in about 30 lines spread over three functions.</p> <p>Yet, this almost impossibly brief implementation has a drawback: its performance is sour - in both theory <i>and </i>practice. The culprit? Each derivative can <i>double</i> the size of a grammar, and with it, the cost of the next derivative.</p> <p>Fortunately, much of the new structure inflicted by the derivative is either dead on arrival, or it dies after the very next derivative. To eliminate it, we once again exploit laziness and memoization to transliterate an equational theory that prunes such debris into working code. Thanks to this compaction, parsing times become reasonable in practice.</p> <p>We equip the functional programmer with two equational theories that, when combined, make for an abbreviated understanding and implementation of a system for parsing context-free languages.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><i><a href=\"http://swannodette.github.io/\">David Nolen</a> </i>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/swannodette/\">@swannodette</a>) is a Software Engineer for <a href=\"http://cognitect.com/\">Cognitect</a> and the lead developer of <a href=\"https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript\">ClojureScript</a>.

Most concurrent software (developed in low-level languages) still relies on error-prone and unscalable memory management techniques for correctness despite the introduction of superior methods over 30 years ago. Safe memory reclamation allows for performant and robust memory management that is also suitable for advanced concurrent programming techniques such as non-blocking synchronization. If properly used, safe memory reclamation techniques allow improved performance and simplicity without the complexity of full-blown garbage collection.</p> <p>This paper provides a terrific overview of common safe memory reclamation mechanisms and then explores their performance implications. In this talk, I will do the same but with stronger emphasis on the introductory aspects of safe memory reclamation and contrast with a refreshed performance analysis.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Samy Al Bahra (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xf390\">@0xf390</a>) is the co-founder of <a href=\"http://backtrace.io\">Backtrace</a>, where he is helping build a modern debugging platform for today's complex applications.

Reinforcement-based learning algorithms such as contextual bandits can be very effective in these settings, but applying them in practice is fraught with technical debt, and no general system exists that supports them completely. We address this and create the first general system for contextual learning, called the Decision Service. Existing systems often suffer from technical debt that arises from issues like incorrect data collection and weak debuggability, issues we systematically address through our ML methodology and system abstractions. The Decision Service enables all aspects of contextual bandit learning using four system abstractions which connect together in a loop: explore (the decision space), log, learn, and deploy. Notably, our new explore and log abstractions ensure the system produces correct, unbiased data, which our learner uses for online learning and to enable real-time safeguards, all in a fully reproducible manner. </i></p> <p><i>The Decision Service has a simple user interface and works with a variety of applications: we present two live production deployments for content recommendation that achieved click-through improvements of 25-30%, another with 18% revenue lift in the landing page, and ongoing applications in tech support and machine failure handling. The service makes real-time decisions and learns continuously and scalably, while significantly lowering technical debt.</i> </p> <p><i><b>Matt Adereth</b> </i>on the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/issue/7/4\"><b>January 1965 issue of The Computer Journal</b></a>:</p> <p><i>This issue contains one of the most important techniques in numerical optimization, the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-abstract/7/4/308/354237/A-Simplex-Method-for-Function-Minimization?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">Nelder-Mead simplex method</a>. <a href=\"https://qconnewyork.com/ny2017/speakers/matt-adereth\">My qCon talk covers the modern distributed version of this algorithm</a>, but in this talk we’re going to try and understand the historical context by looking at everything else in the journal, from the other papers to the letters to the editor to the advertisements.<br/></i></p> <p><i><b>Charity Majors</b> </i>on <b><a href=\"http://db.disi.unitn.eu/pages/VLDBProgram/pdf/industry/p767-wiener.pdf\">Scuba: Diving into Data at Facebook</a></b>:</p> <p><i>Facebook takes performance monitoring seriously. Performance issues can impact over one billion users so we track thousands of servers, hundreds of PB of daily network traffic, hundreds of daily code changes, and many other metrics. We require latencies of under a minute from events occuring (a client request on a phone, a bug report filed, a code change checked in) to graphs showing those events on developers’ monitors.</i></p> <p><i>Scuba is the data management system Facebook uses for most real-time analysis. Scuba is a fast, scalable, distributed, in-memory database built at Facebook. It currently ingests millions of rows (events) per second and expires data at the same rate. Scuba stores data completely in memory on hundreds of servers each with 144 GB RAM. To process each query, Scuba aggregates data from all servers. Scuba processes almost a million queries per day. Scuba is used extensively for interactive, ad hoc, analysis queries that run in under a second over live data. In addition, Scuba is the workhorse behind Facebook’s code regression analysis, bug report monitoring, ads revenue monitoring, and performance debugging.<br/></i></p> <p><i><b>Gwen Shapira</b></i> on <b><a href=\"https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/realtime_data_processing_at_facebook.pdf\">Realtime Data Processing at Facebook</a></b></p> <p><br/><i>Realtime data processing powers many use cases at Facebook, including realtime reporting of the aggregated, anonymized voice of Facebook users, analytics for mobile applications, and insights for Facebook page administrators. Many companies have developed their own systems; we have a realtime data processing ecosystem at Facebook that handles hundreds of Gigabytes per second across hundreds of data pipelines. </i></p> <p><i>Many decisions must be made while designing a realtime stream processing system. In this paper, we identify five important design decisions that affect their ease of use, performance, fault tolerance, scalability, and correctness. We compare the alternative choices for each decision and contrast what we built at Facebook to other published systems. </i></p> <p><i>Our main decision was targeting seconds of latency, not milliseconds. Seconds is fast enough for all of the use cases we support and it allows us to use a persistent message bus for data transport.

We introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses value networks to evaluate board positions and policy networks to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte-Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm,our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs,and defeated the European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.</i></p> <p><br/>- Eric Brewer presenting on <b><a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/Mesa.pdf\">Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa</a></b>:</p> <p><br/><i>The use of monitors for describing concurrency has been much discussed in the literature. When monitors are used in real systems of any size, however, a number of problems arise which have not been adequately dealt with: the semantics of nested monitor calls; the various ways of defining the meaning of WAIT; priority scheduling; handling of timeouts, aborts and other exceptional conditions; interactions with process creation and destruction; monitoring large numbers of small objects. These problems are addressed by the facilities described here for concurrent programming in Mesa. Experience with several substantial applications gives us some confidence in the validity of our solutions.</i></p> <p><br/>-  Ines Sombra presenting on <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/255833/IronFleet-twocol.pdf\"><b>IronFleet: Proving Practical Distributed Systems Correct</b></a>:</p> <p><br/><i>Distributed systems are notorious for harboring subtle bugs.Verification can, in principle, eliminate these bugs a priori,but verification has historically been difficult to apply at full program scale, much less distributed-system scale.We describe a methodology for building practical and provably correct distributed systems based on a unique blend of TLA-style state-machine refinement and Hoare-logic verification.We demonstrate the methodology on a complex implementation of a Paxos-based replicated state machine library and a lease-based sharded key-value store. We prove that each obeys a concise safety specification, as well as desirable liveness requirements. Each implementation achieves performance competitive with a reference system. With our methodology and lessons learned, we aim to raise the standard for distributed systems from “tested” to “correct.” </i></p> <p><br/>-  Caitie McCaffrey presenting on <b><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf\">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures...</a></b>:</p> <p><br/><i>Large, production quality distributed systems still fail periodically,and do so sometimes catastrophically, where most or all users experience an outage or data loss. We present the result of a comprehensive study investigating198 randomly selected, user-reported failures that occurred on Cassandra, HBase, Hadoop Distributed FileSystem (HDFS), Hadoop MapReduce, and Redis, with the goal of understanding how one or multiple faults eventually evolve into a user-visible failure. We found that from a testing point of view, almost all failures require only 3 or fewer nodes to reproduce, which is good news considering that these services typically run on avery large number of nodes. However, multiple inputs are needed to trigger the failures with the order between them being important. Finally, we found the error logs of these systems typically contain sufficient data on both the errors and the input events that triggered the failure,enabling the diagnose and the reproduction of the production failures. </i></p> <p><i>We found the majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code – the last line of defense – even without an understanding of the software design. We extracted three simple rules from the bugs that have lead to some of the catastrophic failures, and developed a static checker, Aspirator, capable of locating these bugs. Over30% of the catastrophic failures would have been prevented had Aspirator been used and the identified bugs fixed. Running Aspirator on the code of 9 distributed systems located 143 bugs and bad practices that have been fixed or confirmed by the developers.</i></p> <p><br/><b>Bios</b></p> <p>- Evelina (Gabasova) is a machine learning researcher working in bioinformatics, trying to reverse-engineer cancer at University of Cambridge.

Lagoudakis and Ronald Parr. </p> <p><br/><b>Talks</b></p> <p>• <i>Gershom Bazerman on Homological Computations for Term Rewriting Systems:</i></p> <p><br/>In 1987, C. Squier wrote \"<i><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404987901290\">Word problems and a homological finiteness condition for monoids</a></i>,\" [1] which proved a fascinating result that spawned an entire field, but which is little known outside of it. The great mathematical popularizer and category theorist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Baez\">John Baez</a> <a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week70.html\">sketched the ideas in 1995</a>. We consider \"word problems,\" which ask the equality of two terms modulo a set of equivalences, restrict ourselves to simple objects called \"&lt;a&gt;monoids&lt;/a&gt;\" that many functional programmers are fond of, and ask about the decidability of equality over them. This is the same as looking at strings and asking when they are equal if you consider mappings that equate some contiguous sequences with other contiguous sequences. (Such problems arise ubiquitously in interesting computational problems -- consider for example the equivalence of sequences of patches, or of edit actions across a distributed system). The way computer scientists would think to answer this is to see if you can rewrite both sides of the equation into a single canonical form that you can compare for equality. Indeed, that's what Don Knuth and Peter Bendix did, and the result is the &lt;a&gt;Knuth-Bendix algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, used in theorem provers and many other applications. </p> <p>But just how universal is the Knuth-Bendix algorithm? Well, Squier showed that there are finite monoids with decidable word problems that cannot be turned into such canonical rewrite procedures as Knuth-Bendix gives us. And furthermore, he showed that this result derives from considering our systems using the tools of modern algebraic topology! In particular, he showed how to calculate a homology of a monoid presentation.  </p> <p>Ever since then, people have been seeking to generalize Squier's result in new and exciting ways. One of the niftiest and newest was presented last year at <a href=\"http://fscd2016.dcc.fc.up.pt/programme/acceptedPapers/\">FSCD</a>,<a href=\"http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~malbos/Art/hcTRS.pdf\"> this talk's paper</a>, which I love, but do not claim to fully understand. Instead of a monoid, we consider an arbitrary \"algebraic theory\" (say, a syntax tree of a programming language with some equalities between certain forms of trees). And we now ask not about the word problem, but just the minimum number of equalities necessary to present such a theory. The answer, which can be computed with an algorithm, comes from even more, and more generalized homology.  The purpose of this talk is to make the above understandable to a lay audience, to sketch some idea of how to think about things that arise in computer science topologically, and to provide an invitation to basic notions of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics)\">homology</a>.</p> <p>• <i>Stephen Tu on Least Squares Policy Iteration:</i></p> <p><br/>Policy iteration is a classic dynamic programing algorithm for solving a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In policy iteration, the algorithm alternates between two steps: 1) a policy evaluation step which, given the current policy, computes the state-action value function (commonly known as the Q-function) for the policy, and 2) a policy improvement step, which uses the Q-function to greedily improve the current policy. When the number of states and actions of the MDP is finite and small, policy iteration performs well and comes with nice theoretical guarantees. However, when the state and action spaces are large (possibly continuous), policy iteration becomes intractable, and approximate methods for solving MDPs must be used. </p> <p>Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) is one method for approximately solving an MDP. The key idea here is to approximate the Q-function as a linear functional in a lifted, higher dimensional space, analogous to the idea of feature maps in supervised learning. Plugging this approximation into the Bellman equation gives a tractable linear system of equations to solve for the policy evaluation step. Furthermore, the policy improvement step remains the same as before.</p> <p>In this talk, I will describe LSPI and some of its subtleties. One subtlety arises due to the fact that the Bellman operator is not necessarily invariant on our approximate function class, and hence an extra projection step is typically used to minimize the Bellman residual after projecting back on the function space. Furthermore, in order to build intuition for LSPI, I will also talk about what the LSPI algorithm does in the context of a well studied continuous optimal control problem known as the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). </p> <p><br/><b>Bios</b></p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://gbaz.github.io/\"><i><b>Gershom Bazerman</b></i></a> is a software developer in New York.

Adding fine-grained access control improves the expressiveness, but often dramatically increases both the cost of system management and implementation complexity. In environments with a more complex management model, with delegation of some management functions to parties under varying degrees of trust, the base UNIX model and most natural extensions are inappropriate at best. Where multiple mutually untrusting parties are introduced, ‘‘inappropriate’’ rapidly transitions to‘‘nightmarish’’, especially with regards to data integrity and privacy protection. The FreeBSD ‘‘Jail’’ facility provides the ability to partition the operating system environment, while maintaining the simplicity of the UNIX‘‘root’’ model. In Jail, users with privilege find that the scope of their requests is limited to the jail, allowing system administrators to delegate management capabilities for each virtual machine environment. Creating virtual machines in this manner has many potential uses; the most popular thus far has been for providing virtual machine services in Internet Service Provider environments.</p> <p><br/>Solaris Zones: Operating System Support for Consolidating Commercial Workloads</p> <p><br/>===========================================</p> <p>Server consolidation, which allows multiple workloads to run on the same system, has become increasingly important as a way to improve the utilization of computing resources and reduce costs. Consolidation is common in mainframe environments, where technology to support running multiple workloads and even multiple operating systems on the same hardware has been evolving since the late 1960’s. This technology is now becoming an important differentiator in the UNIX and Linux server market as well, both at the low end (virtual web hosting) and high end(traditional data center server consolidation).This paper introduces Solaris Zones (zones), a fully realized solution for server consolidation projects in a commercial UNIX operating system. By creating virtualized application execution environments within a single instance of the operating system, the facility strikes a unique balance between competing requirements. On the one hand, a system with multiple workloads needs to run those workloads in isolation, to ensure that applications can neither observe data from other applications nor affect their operation. It must also prevent applications from over-consuming system resources. On the other hand, the system as a whole has to be flexible, manageable, and observable, in order to reduce administrative costs and increase efficiency. By focusing on the support of multiple application environments rather than multiple operating system instances, zones meets isolation requirements without sacrificing manageability.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://michaelrbernste.in\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://tomasp.net\"&gt;</a></p> <p>Bryan Cantrill is the CTO at Joyent, where he oversees worldwide development of the <a href=\"http://smartos.org/\">SmartOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.joyent.com/private-cloud\">SmartDataCenter</a> platforms, and the <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> platform.

Lambdas and the accompanying functional operations like map and filter promise to allow Java programmers to write clearer, simpler code, and to take better advantage of parallelism.</p> <p>While developers of new code will be able to start using the features immediately, what should we do with the billions of lines of code that have already been written? This paper proposes that we can automatically translate the existing body of Java code to make use of the new features.  This improves the readability of the old code, maintains consistency between new and old code, and potentially improves performance.</p> <p>This paper addresses technical debt, an area of software engineering which is only starting to be addressed in academic literature. The authors solve a practical and important problem with a powerful technical tool.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Peter Burka (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pburka\">@pburka</a>) is a member of the software research lab at Two Sigma Investments. He’s interested in many areas of software development, and has recently been dividing his time between exploring programming for many-core devices and finding ways to address technical debt through automation. Previously, he helped develop IBM’s J9 Java virtual machine, where he built the balanced garbage collector and ported the JVM to Palm Pilot, among other achievements. Peter has a great fondness for Smalltalk and is pleased that, 35 years on, its influence can still be seen in so many languages and systems.</p> <p><b>Paper Abstract</b></p> <p>Java 8 introduces two functional features: lambda expressions and functional operations like map or filter that apply a lambda expression over the elements of a Collection. Refactoring existing code to use these new features enables explicit but unobtrusive parallelism and makes the code more succinct. However, refactoring is tedious: it requires changing many lines of code. It is also error-prone: the programmer must reason about the control-, data-flow, and side-effects. Fortunately, refactorings can be automated. We designed and implemented LambdaFicator, a tool which automates two refactorings. The first refactoring converts anonymous inner classes to lambda expressions. The second refactoring converts for loops that iterate over Collections to functional operations that use lambda expressions. Using 9 open-source projects, we have applied these two refactorings 1263 and 1709 times, respectively. The results show that LambdaFicator is useful: (i) it is widely applicable, (ii) it reduces the code bloat, (iii) it increases programmer productivity, and (iv) it is accurate.</p> <p><br/><b>Details</b></p> <p>Doors open at 7 pm; the presentation will begin at 7:30 pm; and, yes, there will be beer, water, and pizza. </p> <p>After Peter presents the paper, we will open up the floor to discussion and questions.  </p> <p>We hope that you'll read the paper before the meetup, but don't stress if you can't.  If you have any questions, thoughts, or related information, please visit our *<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/issues/175\">github-thread</a>* on the matter.</p> <p>Additionally, if you have any papers you want to add to the repository above (papers that you love!), please send us a <a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/pulls\">pull request</a>.

Realizing this phenomenon had not been discussed by psychologists of the day, he set out to describe his observations using the classical formalization of Buridan's ass. Lamport initially failed to have this paper published in various scientific journals, being rejected on grounds of superficiality. It wasn't until 2011, when a reader suggested he resubmit to Foundations of Physics, that the paper was eventually published.</p> <p>Those familiar with the works of Lamport know him as a logician, his life's work has pushed forward the state of the art in areas of mutual exclusion and distributed systems probably more than any other, and so reading Buridan's Principle might strike us as a bit odd, or even obscure. We're in unfamiliar territory with Lamport. Nonetheless, in this paper, Lamport's casual observations lead him to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences, providing us readers with what appears to be a universal law of nature: Buridan's Principle. </p> <p>[0] <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf\"><a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/glitch.pdf</a></a></p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://michaelrbernste.in\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://tomasp.net\"&gt;</a></p> <p>Tom Santero (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsantero\">@tsantero</a>) is a Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.helium.com\">Helium Systems</a>, writing Haskell and Erlang to connect things to the internet.

In so doing, various shortcomings of the original CR protocol have come to light. In this talk, I will summarize these findings and present a new version of CR that addresses the shortcomings.  Our improved CR protocol supports different consistency guarantees, avoids the tail bottleneck for reads, and introduces autonomous reconfiguration of the system without requiring an external master. Additionally, we have developed a formal end-to-end specification of the protocol, including the actions of clients, detailing reconfiguration and linearizable execution of client requests. Through this specification, we are able to reason about the new protocol more precisely and implement the protocol effortlessly.  Lastly, I will contrast our approach to the related work.  </p> <p>• <b>Tiered Replication</b></p> <p>Tiered Replication, by Cidon et. al, explores the problem of effective data replication strategies first introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc15/atc15-paper-cidon.pdf\">Copysets paper</a>, awarded <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc15/technical-session/presentation/cidon\">2013 Usenix ATC Best Student Paper</a>. While Copysets introduced a randomized algorithm for solving NP Hard redundancy and load balancing constraints around placement of data in distributed filesystem, Tiered Replication proposes a greedy algorithm for solving the same problem and also adding the ability to bake in real world constraints such as rack awareness. Wes will summarize the problem Copysets proposed, show <a href=\"https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/trepl\">Tiered Replication’s solution</a>, and examine a real world deployment of the algorithm at Chartbeat.</p> <p><br/><b>Bios</b></p> <p><i><a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~deniz/\">Deniz Altınbüken</a></i>  is a Ph.D. candidate in Distributed Systems at Cornell University, working with <a href=\"https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/\">Robbert van Renesse</a>.

Failure detectors were the most compelling abstraction proposed. These augmented the asynchronous model just enough to allow consensus, while retaining most of the neat abstractions that make asynchronous systems simple to reason about.</p> <p>In this talk, I'll discuss some of the history and background of Chandra and Toueg's failure detector proposal (<a href=\"http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.852/08/papers/CT96-JACM.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.852/08/papers/CT96-JACM.pdf</a>), and discuss some failure detector mechanisms that followed the paper.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Kiran (<a href=\"https://kiranbot.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://kiranbot.com</a>) (@kiranb (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kiranb\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/kiranb</a>)) is a software engineer at Stripe (<a href=\"https://stripe.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://stripe.com</a>).

It outlined how to use Intel Secure Enclaves (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions\" class=\"linkified\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions</a>) to guard containers against attack. Containers are built on the kernel primitives cgroups and namespaces with additional LSM (Linux Security Module) layers on top, such as AppArmor, SELinux, and seccomp. Intel SGX protects code from modification by using protected areas of memory known as enclaves. With containers and adoption of cloud on the rise, this paper continues to be on the cutting edge of what is to come. Some cloud providers are now starting to expose hardware specific features like GPU and SGX, which would make running containers with Intel's SGX trusted execution a reality in the cloud. With Intel's SGX, you can have a container's process shielded from access by other programs. We'll explore how realistic this is today and in the future as well as what benefits this would have to the security of containers.</p> <p>• <i>David Ashby on SHA256</i>: </p> <p><br/>While most of us use hash functions on a daily basis, few people can say that they truly understand what’s actually going on when they call <i>SHA2(\"hello world\")</i>.

As programs have grown in size and complexity, so have the systems that manage garbage collection. Each algorithm makes a different set of tradeoffs between factors such as the space used by objects, the space used by bookkeeping, the number of unused objects (garbage) that remain uncollected, the time spent in allocation, and the time spent in<br/>collection.</p> <p>The Train Algorithm is an incremental generational garbage collector that was designed to deal with the long and unpredictable pause times caused by other algorithms. It does this by grouping objects together on \"cars\" in \"trains\". The algorithm provides a strategy for moving objects from the younger generation into different cars, moving objects from one car to another, and collecting cars and trains. It was first described by Hudson and Moss in the paper \"Incremental<br/>Collection of Mature Objects\".</p> <p>In their paper \"<a href=\"https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/garbage_collection/incremental_mature_garbage_collection_using_the_train_algorithm.pdf?raw=true\">Incremental Mature Garbage Collection Using the Train Algorithm</a>,\" Seligmann and Grarup describe what they believe is the first implementation of the Train Algorithm, which they used to replace the traditional mark-and-sweep collector that was used in the BETA programming language. They discuss their implementation and present information about the performance characteristics of the new algorithm as compared to the original.</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Andrew Turley (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/casio_juarez\">@casio_juarez</a>) is a lead software engineer on the platform team at <a href=\"https://www.theladders.com/\">TheLadders</a>, where he builds infrastructure by linking Storm topologies together using RabbitMQ.

These days, mobile phones are packed with multi core CPUs and even GPUs. Despite these advances in hardware, internet connections in most parts of the world are still surprisingly slow and unreliable.  This creates a challenge: how can files be efficiently transferred between computers over a low-bandwidth, high latency network connection?  In 1996, Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras developed a simple solution which powers one of the most useful UNIX tools, rsync. The algorithm remains relevant 21 years after its invention because it solves a timeless problem.</p> <p>This talk will take you step by step through the rsync algorithm. You will learn that PhD theses are not always scary or unapproachable. Hopefully, you will also leave with a better intuition about the inner workings of rsync,  as well as ideas for how its principles can be building blocks for solving many other different problems.</p> <p><br/><i>Other References</i>:</p> <p>- <a href=\"https://www.samba.org/~tridge/phd_thesis.pdf\">Efficient Algorithms for Sorting and Synchronization</a></p> <p><br/>• <i><b>David Ashby on SHA256</b></i>: </p> <p><br/>While most of us use hash functions on a daily basis, few people can say that they truly understand what’s actually going on when they call <i>SHA2(\"hello world\")</i>.

Hoare. </p> <p><br/><b>Intro</b></p> <p>Our lives now run on software. Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected.</p> <p><br/>A single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees. C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness.</p> <p><br/>In this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas. I will talk about my personal experience using Hoare logic to verify memory guarantees in an operating system. I will also discuss takeaway lessons for working programmers.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Jean Yang (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeanqasaur\">@jeanqasaur</a>) is a final-year PhD student at MIT.

Either the paper is foundational, siring a lineage of important research, or the paper is useful, guiding readers toward clever optimizations, fault-tolerant solutions, and non-intuitive hacks. \"The Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of One-Hole Contexts\" is neither. Only a few papers build on McBride's work and the conclusions of the paper, though promising, haven't yet found any real employ.</p> <p>This paper is lovable, fun, and important because it is a radical thought experiment in the limits of abstraction. The paper poses the question: we call data types \"algebraic\", so can we \"do calculus\" on them? Surely, the nomenclature is just coincidental? What would it even mean to take the derivative of a data type? The paper stretches algebraic data types to what should be their breaking point and then demonstrates that it's not a breaking point ay all. By considering the paper's set-up and implications, we gain a deeper understanding of types and what they abstract. </p> <p>As it will turn out, you can take the derivative of data type and the result is meaningful. The derivative of an algebraic type is another data type, namely the type that can represent any specific context in the original type, any position in the original structure. This relationship is eerily similar to the relationship of functions to their derivatives (roughly, the contextual rate of change) that we all learned in high school. </p> <p>• No previous knowledge of calculus, algebraic data types, zippers, contexts or anything else is required.</p> <p>This talk will cover:</p> <p>- What is an algebraic data type? </p> <p>- What is a zipper and its sister structure, the one-hole context?</p> <p>- How can we derive a one-hole context from any given type? (How can we represent a specific location in an arbitrarily complex tree, type, etc)</p> <p>- What are the one-hole contexts of common types: the list, the binary tree, the ternary tree, and the rose tree?</p> <p>- Why would anyone care?</p> <p><b>Bio</b></p> <p>Erik Hinton (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/erikhinton\">@erikhinton</a>) is an interactive developer for The New York Times.
