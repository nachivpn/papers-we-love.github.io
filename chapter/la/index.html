Software has traditionally been constructed according to the principle that a module should expose its functionality but hide its implementation. This principle, informally known as black-box abstraction, is a basic tenet of software design, underlying our approaches to portability, reuse,and many other important issues in computing. However, in some cases black-box abstraction causes the very problems it is supposed to eliminate.</p> <p>As a programming languages becomes higher and higher level, its implementation in terms of the underlying machines involves more and more trade-offs on the part of the implementer, about what cases to optimize at the expense of other cases.

          <p>Hey Everyone,</p> <p>I couldn't find a speaker available this month &amp; then we lost our room booking.  But let's not let that get us down.  I've got a couple speakers on the docket for April &amp; May.</p> <p>Let's meet at the Daily Pint, enjoy drinks we love, and geek out about computer science.</p> <p>


See you there!</p> <p>Ps. It's buy-your-own-drinks in case that was ambiguous.</p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-LA/events/221186662/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Sam L'ecuyer will present <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/fournet/papers/join-tutorial.pdf">The Join Calculus: a Language for Distributed Mobile Programming</a>, by Cedric Fournet and Georges Gonthier.</p> <p>

--</p> <p>Do semaphores and mutexes, distributed locks and clocks confound you? Does concurrency as an afterthought frustrate and bewilder you? In this paper, Fournet and Gonthier present the join calculus, a modeling language for clean, asynchronous distributed computing. This language builds upon well established techniques of pattern matching, static typing, and local variable declaration to lay the foundation for synchronizing data across multiple machines, code mobility, and failure detection.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Sam L'ecuyer (<a href="https://twitter.com/cateches">@cateches</a>) is a front-end engineer at Yahoo.  You can find a lot of the code he writes at <a href="https://screen.yahoo.com">screen.yahoo.com</a>.
