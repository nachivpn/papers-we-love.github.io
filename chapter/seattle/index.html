This is often feasible and cost-effective where manual programming is not. As more data becomes available, more ambitious problems can be tackled. As a result, machine learning is widely used in computer science and other fields. However, developing successful machine learning applications requires a substantial amount of “black art” that is hard to find in textbooks. This article summarizes twelve key lessons that machine learning researchers and practitioners have learned. These include pitfalls to avoid, important issues to focus on, and answers to common questions.<br>```</p> <p><b>The Main Event:<br>Derek Elkins presents</b> <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~taozou/sosp13/tangososp.pdf">…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/232475084/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Many prior efforts have suggested that Internet video Quality of Experience (QoE) could be dramatically improved by using data-driven prediction of video quality for different choices (e.g., CDN or bitrate) to make optimal decisions. However, building such a prediction system is challenging on two fronts. First, the relationships between video quality and observed session features can be quite complex. Second, video quality changes dynamically. Thus, we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capture these complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions (e.g., simple machine learning approaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus, the potential benefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized. We address these challenges and present the design and implementation of Critical Feature Analytics (CFA). The design of CFA is driven by domain-specif…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/230398379/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Tristan Penman will present Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications.</p> <p>"A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex- periments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes."</p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/227211670/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Trevor Lalish-Menagh will present "A Critique of the CAP Theorem." Abstract:</p> <p>The CAP Theorem is a frequently cited impossibility result in distributed systems, especially among NoSQL distributed databases. In this paper we survey some of the confusion about the meaning of CAP, including inconsistencies and ambiguities in its definitions, and we highlight some problems in its formalization. CAP is often interpreted as proof that eventually consistent databases have better availability properties than strongly consistent databases; although there is some truth in this, we show that more careful reasoning is required. These problems cast doubt on the utility of CAP as a tool for reasoning about trade-offs in practical systems. As alternative to CAP, we propose a "delay-sensitivity" framework, which analyzes the sensitivity of operation latency to network delay, and which may help practitioners reason about the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and tolerance of network fa…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/226493450/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>Abstract</b></p> <p>We present Mesos, a platform for sharing commodity clusters between multiple diverse cluster computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI. Sharing improves cluster utilization and avoids per-framework data replication. Mesos shares resources in a fine-grained manner, allowing frameworks to achieve data locality by taking turns reading data stored on each machine. To support the sophisticated schedulers of today's frameworks, Mesos introduces a distributed two-level scheduling mechanism called resource offers. Mesos decides how many resources to offer each framework, while frameworks decide which resources to accept and which computations to run on them. Our results show that Mesos can achieve near-optimal data locality when sharing the cluster among diverse frameworks, can scale to 50,000 (emulated) nodes, and is resilient to failures.</p> <p><b><br></b></p> <p><b>Presenter:</b></p> <p>Ankur Chauhan</p> <p><b>Links:</b></p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/224064458/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Derek Elkins will present on "Dedalus: Datalog in Time and Space" touching also on some follow-on work.</p> <p><b>Abstract. </b></p> <p>Recent research has explored using Datalog-based languages to express a distributed system as a set of logical invariants. Two properties of distributed systems proved difficult to model in Datalog. First, the state of any such system evolves with its execution. Second, deductions in these systems may be arbitrarily delayed, dropped, or reordered by the unreliable network links they must traverse. Previous efforts addressed the former by extending Datalog to include updates, key constraints, persistence and events, and the latter by assuming ordered and reliable delivery while ignoring delay. These details have a semantics outside Datalog, which increases the complexity of the language and its interpretation, and forces programmers to think operationally. We argue that the missing component from these previous languages is a notion of time.</p> <p>I…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/223224228/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

<b>Abstract</b></p> <p>





Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.</p> <p>
