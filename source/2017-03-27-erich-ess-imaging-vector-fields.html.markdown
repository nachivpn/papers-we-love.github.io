**Description**

[Line Integral Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral_convolution) is one of the most intuitive data visualization techniques around.  It's dropping paint in a river to see how the current is flowing:  to visualize a vector field simply take an image and have the vector field smear the colors.  The result is a powerful alternative to using arrows or stream lines.  And while the intuition is very straightforward, the actual mathematics that power the technique are very complex.

**Bio**

Erich Ess ([@egerhardess](https://twitter.com/egerhardess)) is a lead engineer on the Core Platform team at [Jet.com](https://jet.com/). His current work focuses on semantics for programmatic represention of distributed processes and advanced monitoring and insight platform for high distributed high volume systems. Before that he was a CTO in Chicago and an engineer in San Diego.  He studied Computer Science and Pure Mathematics in college and did research in scientific visualization before escaping academia.
