**Description**

The original Bitcoin paper was published by a pseudonymous individual named Satoshi Nakamoto on Halloween 2008, in the quiet recesses of a small cryptography mailing list, where it was mostly ignored. A couple of months afterwards, Satoshi published the original Bitcoin client software that implemented the ideas in the paper.

Ten years later, a lot has happened both about cryptocurrency, and a lot of money has changed hands. In this talk, we explore the core ideas laid out in the paper, the historical background around digital currencies, and how these ideas and history were implemented in the original Bitcoin client.
