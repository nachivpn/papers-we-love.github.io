****

* **Paper:**[http://bit.ly/2INKnrt](http://bit.ly/2INKnrt)


**Description**

The Connection Machine is a computer that a time traveler borrowed from 2015 and accidentally returned to the wrong decade. How else to explain a 1985 computer with 65,536 processors? That's motivated by doing computer vision? We'll cover The Connection Machine (Danny Hillis's Ph.D. thesis) and the related "Data Parallel Algorithms" in discussing this provocative technological vision. The big question: how did the Connection Machine get so much right but end up a footnote?

**Bio**

Dan Bentley's a software engineer building Live Development as CEO of Windmill. He's opened for The Who, and has a check from Donald Knuth.
