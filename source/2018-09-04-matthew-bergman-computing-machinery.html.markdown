**Description**

68 years ago MIND published ['COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE'](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf) the paper that would gift the world 'The Turing Test'. Everyone knows it, everyone can give the basics of what the turning test is; or at least they think they do.

What exactly is the Imitation Game, how was it framed, and what did Alan Turning actually care about when he proposed this idea? Lets explore together, section by section and see how this paper informed AI in the past and where it is still taking AI today.

**Bio**

Matthew Bergman is a polyglot programmer who cares way more about people and ethics then the code he writes. He is well versed in Ruby on Rails and Western philosophy, especially Hegelian philosophy.
