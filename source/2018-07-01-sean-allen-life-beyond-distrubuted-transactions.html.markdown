**Description**

In 2007, Pat Helland published [“Life Beyond Distributed Transactions: An Apostate’s Opinion,”](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3025012) in which he conducts a thought experiment on how to design a distributed database that can scale almost infinitely. While the paper explicitly addresses distributed database design, I'll show that the ideas are far more widely applicable, particularly in scaling stateful applications. In particular, how we implemented some of the ideas from the paper in our distributed stream processor Wallaroo.

**Bio**
