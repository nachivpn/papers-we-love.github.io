**Description**

This paper explores expansions on the stylistic variety of handmade and artisanal jigsaw puzzles through the application of techniques from natural simulation. Typical jigsaw puzzle designs reflect the manufacturing constraints of die-cut, mass-production methods, but novel families of puzzle forms can be generated by applying a phase field approach to the simulation of dendritic solidification (http://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/dendrites.html). Existing models of solidification with multiphase methods are extended to satisfy aesthetic and geometric considerations specific to jigsaw puzzle design.

It's a mixture of math, physics, and good old-fashioned puzzling.
