# Cairo

We are a community of computer scientists and engineers that are either interested in research papers or desire to get involved in research papers for academic contribution or for improving their career prospects. We deal with papers that have both theoretical and practical inclination, but with an increased focus on the practical side.

Besides gaining further knowledge, another goal of our meetups is to provide a medium for people to collaborate in new research and start-ups especially in emerging fields like neural networks.

Please visit our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Cairo/) page to join us.
