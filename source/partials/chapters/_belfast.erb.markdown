# Belfast Chapter

![Papers We Love Belfast](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/2/8/highres_455261256.jpeg) What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.

The **Belfast Chapter** meets every 2-3 months at different locations throughout the city, and has been runninng since October 2016. Keep an eye on our [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-Belfast/) page to find out the latest address.

Papers We Love has a **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!
