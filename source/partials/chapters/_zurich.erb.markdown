# ZÃ¼rich Chapter

Do you want to talk about a recent paper that you are excited about? Do you want to explain fundamental papers of your field to a wider audience? Do you want to (re-)discover important research works in computer science? Do you have this really cool paper you want to tell us about? Present the papers that you love, tell us about how you've implement them and use them, or simply listen and discuss!

We follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/zurich/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

We keep a [list of papers that we would like to talk about](https://github.com/papers-we-love/zurich/blob/master/paper_ideas.md). Send us pull requests to add your own!
