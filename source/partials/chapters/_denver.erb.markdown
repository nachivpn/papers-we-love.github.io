![Papers We Love Denver](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/2/600_460441762.jpeg)Want to learn the latest way to tech super hard? Or are you itching to know where all those awesome computer science ideas from the 60s led to? Come join the international phenomenon that is Papers We Love! We meet every month to share and discuss papers that have been influential in our own lives and learn what has driven others. It's a ton of fun and a great way to meet other paper-minded folks.

The Denver Chapter meets every fourth Thursday of the month at [Code Talent](https://www.google.com/maps?sll=39.767693,-104.976789&q=3412+Blake+Street+Denver,+CO,+80205,+United+States&z=12).

Papers We Love has a Code of Conduct. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!
