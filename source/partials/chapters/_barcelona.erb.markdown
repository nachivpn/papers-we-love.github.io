# Barcelona Chapter

![Papers We Love BCN](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/1/f/highres_466338207.jpeg) What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.



As a Papers We Love chapter we welcome everyone from the programming community for an evening of ideas, vibrant discussions and hanging out with your fellow travellers.

The **Barcelona Chapter** meets monthly at different locations throughout the city. Keep an eye on our [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-bcn/) page to find out the latest address.

Please make sure to RSVP before attending to make it easier for us to organize all correctly. You can find our schedule and RSVP [here on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-bcn/).

Papers We Love has a **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love-barcelona/organization/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)**. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!
