# Budapest Chapter

Do you want to talk about a recent paper that you are excited about?
Do you want to explain fundamental papers of your field to a wider audience?
Do you want to (re-)discover important research works in computer science?
Do you have this really cool paper you want to tell us about?
Present the papers that you love, tell us about how you've implement them and use them, or simply listen and discuss!

We follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/budapest/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

If you want to give a talk please create an [issue](https://github.com/papers-we-love/budapest/issues) so we can discuss the details.
